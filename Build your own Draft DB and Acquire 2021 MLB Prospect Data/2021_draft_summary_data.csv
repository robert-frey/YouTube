2021,1,50,Marcelo Mayer,SS,HSh,18.58,75,180,L,R,Eastlake HS,USC,50,,High,"Mayer wasn't at as many national events during the 2020 summer since, like most West Coast prospects, he was farthest away from the Southeast states with loose COVID restrictions where they were held. Working in Mayer's favor is that many decision-making team personnel had already seen plenty of him since he shared an infield with former Twins first round pick Keoni Cavaco, and at the time Cavaco was drafted, area scouts thought that Mayer was already the better prospect. This is the most well-rounded player in the draft, a teenage shortstop with a chance to hit for contact, power, and stay at a premium defensive position. He is rhythmic and quiet in the box, covers the whole strike zone, and has surprising power for how effortless his swing is, including to the opposite field. Mayer is a waist-bender and a below-average runner, so there are some club personnel who believe he won't be a shortstop long-term, but he has the hands, actions, and arm strength for the position.

2021,2,51,Henry Davis,C,ColH,21.81,74,195,R,R,Louisville,,50,,Med,"Davis is arguably the safest prospect in the draft because he plays a premium position, has impact raw power, and has no contact red flags. There are teams that are skeptical of his ability to catch but what it means to be a catcher will likely change by the time Davis reaches the big leagues (because of the looming electronic strike zones, which will make framing irrelevant) and put more emphasis on arm strength, which Davis has a plenty of. He does have defensive issues. Davis' size makes it hard for him to crouch like most catchers. He catches on one knee with the bases empty and fewer than two strikes, but when he's in a traditional crouch, he is so high that you could slide an ottoman right through his legs. He also has issues with lateral mobility, ball-blocking, and throwing accuracy. Those issues need considerable polish, but if they're remedied then we're probably talking about an All-Star, since Davis has rare offensive talent for a backstop. He has titanic, strength-driven power and has hit some epic, arching dingers off of scoreboards, and some lasers that get out on a line. Davis swung and missed just 63 times on film this year, according to Syngery Sports, which is a 7.6% swinging strike rate, comfortably better than the big league average of 11.5%. It feels like there's enough bat here to profile as a 1B/DH even if the catching piece doesn't work out, which is why Davis has a top-of-the-draft blend of ceiling and floor.",https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=henry+davis+mlb+draft,0,0,Med,70,2,0
2021,3,54,Jack Leiter,SP,ColP,21.22,73,195,R,R,Vanderbilt,,50,,Med,"He didn't have the prototypical frame, but otherwise Leiter was a typical late-first round prep arm with plus on-mound athleticism and breaking ball feel. There were industry rumors about Leiter only wanting to eschew his Vanderbilt commitment if it meant signing with a couple of teams (rumored to be some combination of the New York teams and Philly), and he was going to be a draft-eligible sophomore in just a couple of years anyway, so he ended up in Nashville. Leiter was electric during his COVID-shortened freshman season, showing more arm strength than he had in high school. He vaulted to the top of our draft board here at FanGraphs on the strength of his month-long true freshman season due largely to confidence in his fastball's playability relative to other college arms. Still, it was just four weeks with the new velo. Then this spring Leiter showed yet another velo bump early and settled into the 94-97 mph range for most of 2021, a year that included a homer-prone stretch and a week off for rest and maintenance as we approached postseason play. Leiter is a modern power pitcher with feel for pitch execution that comes and goes. When he's on, he's blowing his fastball past hitters in the zone because of the velo and carry on the pitch, some of which is aided by Leiter's medium size and big stride down the mound. With that he pairs two breaking balls. The curveball, which lives in the upper-70s and has big vertical depth, is the more consistent of the two right now. It and his low-80s slider can sometimes run together, and the biggest piece of Leiter's pro development will be either defining these two breakers more clearly (i.e. throw a harder slider) or mastering a changeup, which sometimes flashes bat-missing action but which Leiter barely throws. This isn't a Stephen Strasburg type of prospect, but Leiter's overall profile is consistent with prospects who come off the board in the top five picks of a draft.",https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jack+leiter+mlb+draft,0,1,Short,,2,2

He has an up-the-middle defensive projection (probably second base) and the potential for star-level power and speed output. Watson has a badass uppercut swing and his smaller frame and short levers prevent the swing from being too long and vulnerable to velocity (though he hasn't seen a ton of big velo). The unknown piece here is Watson's breaking ball recognition. He was able to adjust to hangers during the summer of 2020 but swung over the top of many buried breaking balls, and then didn't face many good ones during varsity play in 2021. How that piece of his skillset develops will dictate the blend of contact and power Watson ends up having, but the talent for plenty of both is present. Watson has plus infield range and defensive footwork but his hands and arm strength are less stellar. He's fine moving from right to left, in on the infield grass, but doesn't have the arm for making plays deep in the 5/6 hole.

He has terrific defensive hands, feet, and actions, enough arm strength for the left side of the infield, and he showed advanced feel to hit and barrel control on the showcase circuit while inexplicably struggling with swing and miss during the spring of 2021. While employing an all-fields approach, Lawlar hit pitches all over the strike zone during summer showcases. He's a graceful, smooth and instinctive defender who is the most likely to remain at shortstop of the top-of-the-draft high schoolers. He's also the one least likely to end up hitting for impact power because we're not talking about a projectable, explosive athlete here. Nearly a year older than Kahlil Watson, the cement on Lawlar's frame is that much drier.

2021,6,,Brady House,3B,HSh,18.10,75,200,R,R,Winder-Barrow HS,Tennessee,45,Y,High,"House has a big, imposing frame and broad shoulders that look like cantalope halves under his jersey. He is as physical as any high school prospect in this draft class and has been for quite some time, as House has often played -- and performed -- against older high schoolers for several years. Some scouts thought he should have reclassified to the 2020 Draft, where he'd have been a likely first rounder at age 17.0. The carrying tool here is power. House hits the ball as hard and as consistently as any high schooler in the class. He's at his best when getting extended on pitches away from him, which he often drives the other way. A stiff, upright swing and longer levers might lead to exposed holes later on against advanced pitching, and House did swing and miss a little more than average on the summer showcase circuit. But he's got a long track record of on-paper performance against mostly older competition, in addition to the obvious physical ability. While he's played a lot of shortstop in high school, House's size and general stiffness both point to a move to third base, and maybe even RF/1B later in his career. He runs very well underway for his size and will make the occasional slick-looking play on the infield despite having a relatively stiff lower half. There are times he makes you wonder if he could be above-average at third base for a while, but the size and lack of flexibility point the compass toward right field at least a little bit. House might grow into elite raw power and has had enough feel for contact to weaponize it so far. ",https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brady+house+mlb+draft,2,0,Long,50,2,-1

He tracks pitches with laser-guided precision, is able to make mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls, and he's adept at hitting pitches on the outer third to the opposite field. Folks clamoring for more balls in play will love watching Cowser hit. His in-zone contact rate, per Synergy Sports, was just 5.6% this year. That would be one of the five-to-10 best in-zone contact rates in a typical year. Cowser has a narrow build and he doesn't have big raw power, but he's a plus runner capable of playing in center field. Clubs would have loved to have seen him hit with wood during a normal 2020 and see his feel to hit stress tested against better pitching than the Southland Conference has to offer. Still, of the 75 fastballs Cowser saw in excess of 93 mph in 2021, he only swung and missed at three.

2021,8,,Kumar Rocker,SP,ColP,21.64,77,250,R,R,Vanderbilt,,45,Y,High,"Rocker looked like a first rounder for much of his high school career, but his stuff dipped as the 2018 draft approached while his asking price did not, so teams backed away and Rocker went to college. After a rocky first few weeks of his Vanderbilt career, he became dominant down the stretch, culminating in a 19-strikeout no-hitter against Duke. That outing and Vanderbilt's run to a national title made Rocker a household name, even among most casual baseball fans. He made just three starts as a sophomore before COVID-19 ended the season, two strong (vs UIC and UConn) and one not (UCLA). Rocker came out for the 2021 season in what looked like the best shape he's ever been in, and with a slightly higher arm slot. He was dominant early on, then his stuff slipped into the low-90s as his delivery looked like it featured more and more effort. His roller coaster performance during the last couple of years is perhaps a bit of a blemish on an otherwise typical top-of-the-class power pitcher profile led by a mid-90s fastball and plus, upper-80s slider. Rocker also showed burgeoning feel for his mid-70s curveball late in the year.

He has several catalytic qualities already and might hit for more in-game power later as his swing and approach evolve. Right now Frelick is a slap-and-slash hitter who'll occasionally show you low-ball power. He has good vertical plate coverage and can catch pitches near the top of the zone. It takes projecting on some elements of Frelick's offense to see him as an impact regular, but so much of his skillset is either new or changing (he's also played some second base) and we're betting on late development here because of the multi-sport, Northeast background and time lost due to a 2019 knee injury/surgery.",https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sal+frelick+mlb+draft,-1,1,Short,50,1,0

He also generates elite spin on a plus-flashing slider and will flash an above-average changeup. Jobe's fastball has tailing action, so its ability to miss bats is going to be more velo/location dependent than those of his backspinning peers, but there's still a shot for three 55-grade (or better) pitches here.",https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jackson+jobe+mlb+draft,0,1,Med,,1,-1

He had a tough freshman year at UCLA while playing in the outfield for the first time due to the draft-eligible depth in the Bruins' infield (Toglia, Strumpf, Kreidler); he then bounced back on the Cape and during an abbreviated 2020. Back at shortstop for most of 2021, McLain quelled concerns about his ability to play there. After a slow start with the bat he got hot in the middle of his junior year and solidified his status as a mid-first round prospect. McLain knows how to lift the ball in games despite having fringe raw power and his hit/pop combo should be enough to profile at either middle infield position or in center field if his new team wishes to revisit that.

He was back into the mid-90s during the early part of 2020 and touching the upper-90s during Texas' fall practices. Skepticism about his ability to hold that kind of stuff through a whole season proved prescient as Madden hit sort of a wall toward the end of the year, and his stuff was not as crisp. His delivery is very upright and his arm slot very vertical, so he works with downhill angle similar to a treacherous ski slope.

He had growing pains as a freshman, but looked crisp in the fall of 2019, which was the start of his ascent to legitimate college ace. Through 2021 Hoglund was arguably the most polished college arm in the class, sitting in the low-90s, while dotting a plus slider on the corner with remarkable consistency. Healthy Hoglund has the best command in this draft. His fastball's tailing action garners looking strikes on the glove-side corner and sets up Hoglund's changeup, which needs to develop. Toward the ends of a dominant 2021, Hoglund looked awkward and uncomfortable warming up for a start and was removed from it early on. He would need Tommy John. We look at his rehab as an opportunity to rework a softer build and maybe exit the process with more velocity.

There's a real chance he comes out as a switch-hitting shortstop with mistake power.

His best pitch is a present plus curveball with heavy downward action that checks plenty of team’s analytical boxes. He’ll flash a rare changeup that should end up average. Mizzicato throws a lot of strikes, but like most prep arms, will need to learn how to command within the zone.

He’s a premium performance lefty stick with some past experience at a more favorable defensive position than he’s playing now. Zavala spent all of 2021 in right field but played third base during the shortened 2020. While definitely well-below average there (several of those games were against Grand Canyon), Zavala was able to make easy plays and it’s worth a try in pro ball to see if he can improve enough to stick. 
His bat is the carrying attribute, though. Zavala is very physical, he has above-average bat control, and a great idea of the strike zone and in which parts of it he’s capable of doing damage. He walked 50 times and struck out just 31 in 2020 while slashing .392/.525/.628 in the Pac-12. Zavala can turn on mistakes up, and while he doesn’t always cover the outer third, he typically does a good job laying off pitches that are out there, and if they catch enough of the plate he can drive them the other way with power. He also has an advanced two-strike approach. We think that once clubs start to have meetings and the results of draft models become known, Zavala will rise as high as the back of round one. Big conference lefty sticks with hit/power/approach troikas aren’t exactly common, and Zavala is barely going to be 21 on draft day.

Nelson is a palatable receiver (one knee, then squats w/ two strikes and rummers on) who can post sub-two-second pop times from his knees, though not often with precise accuracy.

He’s gone from topping out around 94 to sitting 93-96 and topping out around 100, per Synergy Sports. Mikulski’s delivery is pretty violent and he has a nasty head whack but he also has pretty consistent feel for all four of his pitches, especially his changeup. Where Mikulski ends up being drafted will probably be impacted by his signability. He’s a senior and has less leverage than someone with more college eligibility remaining, which means a team might want to take him early for an underslot bonus and then try to sign a falling high schooler to an overslot deal later. We saw a version of this happen with Landon Knack last year, but Mikulski has a better chance to start and has performed against slightly better competition. There's relief risk here because of the mechanical stiffness, but Mikulski's pitch execution with the new delivery has been pretty consistent.

He didn't pitch in the fall but was ready to go for his sophomore spring and was up to 97 in the preseason before being up to 99 during the early part of the shortened 2020 campaign. After generating mixed results early in 2021, Hill blew out and needed Tommy John. In addition to his changeup, Hill has two breaking balls (LSU calls them a slider and cutter, but they have more curve/modern slider sensibilities), the best of which is a slider/cutter in the 88-90 mph range.

His swings hard at everything, and showed a tendency to strike out at times, leading some to put a power-over-hit tag on him.

Then he struggled early in 2020 before getting hot for about a month in the middle of the college season, and then again during conference tournament play. Binelas is short to the ball and has big, majestic power but his swing is fairly grooved. He struggles with fastballs up and away from him and has a somewhat scary strikeout-to-walk ratio for a corner infielder. He doesn't have an especially projectable frame and though he's worked to get himself in better shape than he was in as a freshman, Binelas projects to first base for most scouts.

It included 12 games against eventual regional host and top-16 team Louisiana Tech, as well as games against Mississippi State, Alabama, Florida State and Ole Miss, and four against South Alabama, who made a deep regional run. Trimble does have an expansive approach and is apt to chase, but he is ultra toolsy for a smaller-framed prospect. A switch-hitter, he is an explosive rotator from both sides of the plate. He has pull-side power as a righty hitter but will take you deep to any field from the left side. Both of his swings have natural loft, but they’re not all that long because Trimble is so compact. He’s also a plus runner with gap-to-gap range in center field and an above-average arm (he can get a little carried away trying to throw guys out), so there’s room for him to profile even if the approach hurts his offensive production. Also remember Trimble missed most of his true freshman season because of the pandemic. I’m less apt to think/hope that hitters can develop ball/strike recognition over time, but some of the players whose key career years overlap with the pandemic have had so few reps that perhaps there are some exceptions to this floating around. Plus, these kinds of players’ plate discipline rate stats are less reliable than usual because they’ve generated smaller career samples due to the lost year.

Mostly, this is an athletic, young strike-thrower who teams think can and will throw harder. It's a sinker/changeup mix with the two breaking balls that need polish so they're not easy to tell apart out of hand. McGreevy's velocity was way down in his final start of 2021 and he sat 90-92 as opposed to the mid-90s.

He's a contact-oriented hitter who peppers the opposite baseline with flares and line drives, so while he has the power to punish mistakes, Del Castillo projects to have a hit-tool driven profile. His receiving and throwing are okay, enough that he'll likely remain a catcher, but he doesn't project as an impact defender.
