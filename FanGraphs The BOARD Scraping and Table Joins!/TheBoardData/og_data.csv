It's not expected to be a long-term issue, and Franco himself wanted to rest and return to action for Escogido (the left side of los Leones infield would have been him and Vladimir Guerrero Jr.), but the Rays prevented it as a precaution. I suppose there's some chance that this issue, combined with the presence of other good shortstops in the org like Willy Adames and Taylor Walls (assuming either or both aren't traded) creates a heightened chance that Franco debuts in the big leagues as a second baseman, but even if we knew that was going to be the case, he'd still easily be the best prospect in baseball. 
In fact, last year Franco became the first 80 FV prospect of the Future Value era at FanGraphs, the best prospect on the planet, and the best I've evaluated during my tenure here at the site. Recall Franco's statistical track record, which is better than Vladdy's was at the same age and levels: He has played 175 career games, all at levels well above what is typical for a player his age (he doesn't turn 20 until March). During those games, he hit .336/.405/.523 with 71 extra-base hits, 20 steals, and more walks than strikeouts. In fact, across two levels in 2019, Low- and Hi-A, Franco not only walked more than he struck out, but walked about <em>twice</em> as much. He has one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the minor leagues at a paltry 4.8%. Franco's short levers and lightning-quick wrists make it nearly impossible to beat him with velocity, especially on the inner half. He is also especially adept at spoiling well-located back-foot breaking balls, and if you miss with one and catch even part of the zone, he can drop the bat head and yank it out to his pull side. Work away from him and he'll extend his arms and pepper the opposite field gap with line drives, then use his speed to turn lots of those into doubles. He has impressive raw juice in BP, which he shows off because he makes such consistent contact (his 2019 Futures Game BP was better than Jo Adell's and Nolan Jones' even though those guys have bigger raw power), but it's possible Franco's in-game power hasn't fully actualized yet because he still hits the ball on the ground a lot (48% in 2019, with just a 9 degree average launch angle). And yet he's still slugging like a physically mature Quad-A hitter. How about the TrackMan data? Franco's exit velos and hard hit rate (which are on The Board) are both above the big league average, which is ridiculous for a teenager who's playing against competition four and a half years older than he is. 
He might not ever produce huge home run totals without a swing change (someone told me, ""If that's true, then imagine a Michael Brantley-type of hitter who switch-hits and plays shortstop""), but it'd be ridiculous to alter this guy's swing considering how elite his performance has been, and I think the elite bat-to-ball skills will enable him to hit for more game power than his raw.  Franco has been the best player his age on the planet since he was 14 years old. He looks like, and has performed like, a generational talent and annual MVP contender. <em>(Alternate site, LIDOM)</em>","OsxMtDgMaI0","sa3007033"

Yes, the 2020 Padres needed pitching, and it was thought entering 2020 spring training that San Diego would not hesitate to promote either Gore or Luis Patiño if they pitched well enough in the minors. Patiño got the call, as did Ryan Weathers eventually, but even when their staff was decimated by injury and throwing bullpen game after bullpen game in the playoffs, Gore did not. Because the Padres' taxi squad trained at the University of San Diego (where there's no TrackMan unit) and the team did not opt in to alternate site video sharing, other clubs do not have a real idea of how Gore looked at the alt site. The Padres acknowledge he was struggling to synch his mechanics, which seems feasible given their complexity. 
After 2020, Gore has now had bizarre issues in two of the last three seasons (he dealt with blisters throughout 2018), but sandwiched between them was one of the most dominant minor league seasons of the last several years, during which Gore was in the top five in minor league ERA, Swinging Strike Rate and Strikeout-to-Walk Ratio among pitchers who threw at least 100 innings. He made 15 starts in the Cal League and surrendered just nine runs. <em>In the Cal League.</em> Aside from the way his fastball plays (it averaged 93 in 2019, has carry and cut, and generated a 17% swinging strike rate, 16% overall), this is not a power pitcher. Gore has typically been athletic enough to maintain his very deceptive, intricate mechanics and execute his bevy of secondary pitches with consistency. His changeup has bat-missing action when it's located but his curveball and slider rely on deception and location to miss bats, and Gore has typically been able to provide both. Ideally, at least one of his breaking balls will take a bit of a step forward, and it's reasonable to hope one still might since this guy has still only had one full minor league season. I'm writing 2020 off as a developmental hiccup rather than one featuring a role-altering injury. If his stuff appears down or there's more evidence of persistent mechanical trouble, that's when I think it'll be time to reassess. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","7bZP4Vs1QhA","sa3005068"

From his sophomore season onward (and arguably starting in the Fall before that), he went wire-to-wire as the top prospect in his class, a complete player and the best draft prospect in half a decade. His entire profile is ideal. It's rare for ambidextrous swingers to have polished swings from both sides of the plate, and even more so to have two nearly identical, rhythmic swings that produce power. 
It's more atypical still for that type of hitter to be a great defender at a premium position. Rutschman has a pickpocket's sleight of hand and absolutely cons umpires into calling strikes on the edge of the zone, and resolute umpires end up hearing it from biased fans who are easier marks. Aside from two instances, all of my Rutschman pop times over three years of looks are between 1.86 and 1.95 seconds, comfortably plus times on throws often right on the bag. Rutschman has the physical tools to become the best catcher in baseball, provided he stays healthy (he had some shoulder/back stuff in college). He's also an ultra-competitive, attentive, and vocal team leader who shepherds pitchers with measured but intense encouragement. It fires up his teammates and feels like it comes from a real place, rather than something he's forcing. Aside from the questions that arose as teams scrutinized Rutschman's medicals with a magnifying glass before the draft (it was described to me as ""stuff consistent with catching and playing football""), he's a perfect prospect subject only to the risk and attrition that all catchers face. 
Because the 2020 minor league season was cancelled, we have no full-season looks nor data to alter or buttress this foundation, and Adley looked the same as ever in the Fall. I realize readers will have Matt Wieters flashbacks because Rutchsman's frame and switch-hitting, upright stance are dead ringers for Wieters', but this guy's blood courses through his veins at a much different temperature. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","riXzQCIbfPw","sa3011643"

I think this is a real, relevant change and helped drive his debut season's triple slash line, a star-like .281/.382/.641 in the regular season and God-like .500/.538/1.042 in the playoffs. A pertinent data point here is Arozarena’s max exit velo, which was 109 mph in 2019 and moved up to 113 mph in 2020. This is a measurable change in physical ability, the reason for which is well-publicized and which is supported by a visual evaluation of Arozarena’s physicality. And I’m not too worried about the sudden uptick in his strikeout rate because it not only occurred in a small sample but is way above his career norm of 18.5% (I'm avoiding recency bias), and the circumstances surrounding it (Arozarena rolled out of quarantine bed and faced big league pitching for the longest stretch of his life) are odd. We also got our first glimpse of how opponents are going to pitch to Arozarena now that he's a certified masher, and I think that his walk rate and OBP are both going to take a pretty serious leap. His newfound physique might also bring about a change to his approach to contact (this guy once looked like a leadoff hitter) as he continues to get a feel for what it's like to have this much juice, but I'm not sure how that will manifest on the field. I think the added weight has made him a worse defender and now have a 40 on him in left field, not that it matters. He's likely to anchor the middle of the Rays order for the next half decade. It should be noted that Arozarena was involved in an altercation related to a custody dispute this offseason; he was released from custody after his former partner declined to press charges. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","4VdQSUbzmz8","19290"

He got regular big league at-bats during spring training ahead of the shutdown, then had some very high-profile homers during summer camp and at the alternate site, which you probably already know because the Mariners' prospect PR machine is very strong. I wrote last year that even though Kelenic had become a maxed-out beefcake, it hadn't detracted from his ability to play a fringe center field. More recent scout looks indicate that may no longer be the case, as several of them think Kelenic's size at his age may eventually push him to the 1B/DH realm, or at least cause him to slow down and be below-average in an outfield corner.
I don't think it matters. Kelenic rakes. His feel for contact, strength, and mature approach combine to make him a lethal offensive threat. He is short to the ball with power, and can rip his top hand through to catch fastballs at the top of the zone, which bodes well for him against a pitching population that is working up there with increasing frequency. He's been the among the most polished hitters his age since he was 15 and has a track record of statistical success dating back to his underclass high school days...he's just added upwards of 30 pounds of muscle to that foundation of skill. I expect him to come up in 2021 and be an immediate impact player. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","LFdX2RZaB64","sa3007741"

I thought it was an irresponsible comp when I first heard it, but Abrams does kind of swing like Kenny Lofton. The way Abrams' bat traverses the zone and the way his head kicks back like the butt of a shotgun when he really lays into a ball are both evocative of Lofton, as is Abrams' speed. 
But my main takeaway from the 2020 Fall look was how much better of an infielder I thought Abrams had become. Over the last decade or so, infielders who have tended to be on the middle infield/center field line due to poor arm strength or utility (Billy Hamilton, Roman Quinn) have trended to the outfield, so I had been projecting Abrams there. Now I think he can make enough of the throws to play second base, though I also think it makes sense for the Padres to give him reps in center for the sake of versatility, and they might want to do it soon because Abrams' bat is coming quickly. The .401/.442/.662 line he posted throughout the summer after he was drafted isn't sustainable -- players who run as well as he does are a nightmare for rookie-ball infields and Abrams posted a .425 BABIP -- but Abrams can absolutely rake. His gaze appears to be laser-guided as he tracks pitches deep into the hitting zone, he has a knack for impacting the baseball in a way that creates hard contact even though his swing is currently pretty flat, and he can do so all over the strike zone. Of the trio of elite middle infield prospects who still aren't yet old enough to drink (Abrams, Bobby Witt, and Marco Luciano), Abrams has the most polished hit tool and the most room left on his frame. Even without a swing change, he's going to grow into more power through physical maturity, which is pretty scary considering his exit velos were already above the big league average in 2019 (though, again, AZL pitching wasn't good that year). This is the best leadoff-hitting prospect in baseball. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","UhCOxi0kL08","sa3010152"

The data does some pushing and pulling. In about a month, Hayes hit a whopping .376/.442/.682, ranked fourth among all hitters with a 195 wRC+, and led all NL rookies with 1.7 WAR even though he only played in 24 games. And Hayes was hitting the ball hard. His big league average exit velocity (just shy of 93 mph) and HardHit% (55%) were both above what he posted in the 2019 minors (91 mph, 48%) when he only hit 10 homers over a 100 games. But his .450 BABIP is unsustainable and, per Statcast, his xwOBA (.356) came in well below his actual wOBA (.464), indicating that he was also the beneficiary of some luck. There's no accounting for how big league pitching might expose a weakness and begin to adjust to Hayes, even if it's just to limit his power output rather than get him out. But his approach is responsive enough that I think he'll target pitches he can drive and do enough damage to, when coupled with his world-class defense at third base, make him a multi-time All-Star. <em>(Alternate Site, MLB)</em>","o76lKnW1nX0","18577"

Even though he hit .278/.340/.474 as a 20-year-old at Double-A Mississippi, there are still some level-headed, long-term questions about Pache's offensive ability. He had a 17% swinging strike rate in 2019 (if we 20-80'd swinging strike rates, that'd be a 30), and you might quibble with elements of the swing, most notably that the bat path only allows for power in certain parts of the zone, and that Pache's pitch recognition is just okay (it actually looks better this spring). But Pache can square velocity and he's a ferocious rotator with power. He's also athletic enough to make adjustments in order to get to that power (though selectivity might be an issue). Couple this power-hitting potential with some of the flashiest, most acrobatic defense in pro baseball and Pache has a cathedral's ceiling. 
Pache's reads in center, his contortionist's ability to slide and dive at odd angles to make tough catches and position himself to throw, as well as his arm strength, combine to make him an elite defensive center fielder. He's a likely perennial Gold Glover barring an unexpected, precipitous physical regression. Even if he's not posting All-Star offensive statlines, he'll provide All-Star all-around value.

Indeed, after he hit a combined .336/.445/.722 as a freshman and sophomore, Tork was off to a ridiculous .340/.598/.780 start to his final college season, and was leading the country in walks as opposing pitchers began to fearfully dump in more and more breaking balls against him. As the draft approached, he began to swing over the top of those breaking balls more than usual, which might have been because either he was pressing due to the looming draft, or because of the lack of an impact sidekick in ASU's lineup since Hunter Bishop was no longer hitting behind him. Torkelson has sublime hitter's timing, plus bat speed, and above-average barrel control and ball/strike recognition, really only struggling with those breaking balls located beneath the zone, which may be easy to remedy with a slightly longer stride to create more barrel depth. The Tigers announced him as a third baseman, and it makes sense for them to explore if he can be even a 35- or 40-grade defender there. He's been surprisingly acceptable at third this spring, but with body comps to Yankees first baseman Luke Voit, it's going to be a struggle to stick there. It's a tough profile, but his elite statistical track record and the visual evaluation of Torkelson's hitting acumen align and serve to generate confidence that he'll be a thumping, heart of the order hitter.

This time his malady, described as right elbow tightness, was actually arm-related after he had previously dealt with an intercostal strain and a fractured ulna caused by a comebacker. The Blue Jays shut him down for about a month, and when Pearson returned he did so as a reliever. Upon coming back, his fastball velocity was not only intact but he threw harder than he did as a starter before he was shut down (he averaged 99 mph after ""only"" throwing 96 as a starter). After just one post-injury regular season outing, Pearson came out of the bullpen in the final game of Toronto's Wild Card round loss to the Rays, and absolutely paved over Tampa Bay hitters who had just shelled Hyun Jin Ryu. The question the industry hoped Pearson would answer in 2020 was, ""Can this guy hold upper-90s cheese all year, every fifth day, as a starter?"" I think the answer to that is probably no, and I also think that based on how difficult it's been for him to build a starter's inning count in the minors, Pearson might spend his first couple of big league seasons in some kind of truncated starter's role or as a multi-inning relief weapon. 
But he does have front-end stuff in his fastball and mid-80s slider, which is often a 70 on the scale. Pearson also walked a bunch of hitters during his 2020 debut but his in-zone location rate was about the big league average, and he pretty consistently executes his fastball and slider where they should be located, so I think it's unlikely he moves to the 'pen for command-related reasons. He also has a curveball and changeup that round out the starter-worthy repertoire, though he's never really been able to throw that curveball for strikes and I'd speculate that the changeup ends up as the tertiary pitch here. His changeup flashes plus but his feel for locating it consistently isn't great, and I think that pitch needs to develop if he's going to max out as a starter. Because FV is a WAR-based prediction and Pearson's innings are likely to be somewhat limited early in his career, perhaps I should have kept his FV in the 55 tier even though he returned from the elbow injury with his usual velocity. But I'm 60'ing him here because of his high-end outcomes, which I think also include a truly elite relief possibility. There's a chance Toronto eventually does with him what the Reds did with Aroldis Chapman, where the team is competitive and Pearson is thriving in a relief role, so they just leave him there. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","t_D8-uewjYw","20160"

In January of 2019, when most baseball facilities across the country were dark, just feet away from oblivious Peloton riders and tennis-playing retirees, a few lucky scouts and media folks had a religious experience watching the sweetest-swinging teenager on Earth absolutely roast balls fed to his barrel by a high-speed pitching machine. Because of how close you can sit next to the field there, you can feel the sonic force of bat-to-ball impact radiate into your body. When Marco Luciano connects, you feel it to your core. He is not normal. To find bat speed comps you need to look toward Javier Báez, Eric Davis, or whoever the top of your mental catalog might be. And while he already generates plenty of it, Luciano's square-shouldered frame indicated more power might be coming. After hitting the weight room throughout 2020, he weighed in for 2021 Spring Training at a square-shouldered 208, nearly 30 pounds heavier than his 2019 listed weight. The length created by Luciano's natural, uppercut swing is offset by the explosiveness in his hands; he's not particularly strikeout-prone and he doesn't take out-of-control hacks. Unless something unforeseen is exposed about Luciano's approach as he moves through the minors, all of this power seems likely to actualize in games. His AZL walk rate is encouraging early evidence that he's unlikely to be so exposed.
As an athlete and infielder, Luciano is only fair. He might play a passable shortstop one day because his hands and actions are fine most of the time, but he can't presently make strong, accurate throws from multiple platforms and his routine tosses to first don't have that silky smooth shortstop vibe. It looks increasingly likely, especially now that he's added a bunch of weight, that he'll move to either third base or the outfield, enough so that some scouts have him projected there. But it's too early, from a developmental standpoint, to cut bait and move him. He has elite hitting talent, he's produced on paper, and he already has an average exit velo and a hard-hit rate that grade as 65s on the big league scale. If he continues to perform, especially if he hits his way to the upper levels, then this time next year we'll be talking about Marco Luciano as one of the best prospects in baseball, and if he does so while improving his infield defense, perhaps <em>the</em> best. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","UrZDHmjnjrY","sa3010022"

Some of that doubt is the result of his size (I specifically don't have these concerns), while the rest is the result of his sub-par control/command. Indeed Patiño's BB/9 rose as he was promoted to each of his previous four minor league levels, culminating in a gnarly 16.5% walk rate during a small 2020 big league sample. For someone as short as Patiño is, his arm swing is actually quite long, and his tactile feel for release has seemingly regressed as he's gotten more muscular. But remember that this is one of the better on-mound athletes in the minors, who is still only the age of a college prospect, and who hasn't had elite velocity for very long. Since he signed, Patiño has gained about 40 pounds and added about 10 ticks of fastball velocity. More important context: Patiño is a converted infielder who has only been focused on pitching for about five years, and one of those was seriously disrupted by the pandemic. Certainly Patiño needs to find more mechanical consistency and his fastball location needs to move north. Plus, his changeup feel is still quite raw. But if this guy were at LSU or UCLA, we'd be talking about him as the odds-on favorite to go number one overall in this year's draft.

He hit .259/.394/.444 in the spring off of admittedly diluted pitching, then grinded out long, tough at-bats during the summer tune-up against a staff that would turn out to be quite good. He's also one of the more decorated college hitters ever, slashing .374/.495/.688 at Cal. 
He's very likely to clear the high offensive bar at first base. He's not a great feet-and-hands athlete on the infield but Vaughn's swing is pretty athletic, and sweet. He doesn't chase and seems to have a narrow early-count approach focused on pitches he can crush. He's less able to damage well-executed breaking stuff away from him, but he often spoils those pitches or puts them in play and, again, typically doesn't offer at them until he has to. There's a clearer path to the big leagues for Vaughn now that Edwin Encarnacion and Nomar Mazara are no longer on the roster (I talk more about this in the System Overview), and he'll likely play in the big leagues in 2021.

It's possible the wait is over and that Marsh's swing is now in a place that will enable him to hit for power more in line with the thump he shows in batting practice, but his in-season slugging performance (.428 in 2019, up from .385 the year before) is not the evidence for that.

Like Jo Adell showed late in the Fall, Marsh's hands loaded a little farther out away from his body and he had what some scouts called a ""wrap"" or ""power tip,"" where the bat head is angled toward the mound a bit, setting up more of a loop than a direct path to the ball. I thought he lifted the ball better during that six week stretch and did so without compromising his strong feel for contact. He could blow up this year. He's also a clean fit in center field and his range out there might be better than Trout's is at this point, though obviously the notion of moving Trout to a corner comes with other considerations. I think Marsh is an All-Star talent. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","f6w57ie4WkA","sa917944"

He's also athletic and moves well for his size. I still have some questions about his ultimate upside because I think he's much more likely to end up in left field than in center. His instincts in center are okay, but I don't think he has the long speed that is typical at the position. His 2019 minor league TrackMan data indicates his statline from that year was a bit of a caricature, but his Savant page indicates the opposite with regard to his 2020 debut struggles. I wonder if pro models have been overrating Carlson due to his age because even though he's only the age of a college bat, he doesn't have the physical projection you'd expect of a hitter that age. Of course, it's not like Juan Soto still has physical projection, either. The league-average offensive production in left field has been lower than you might expect (good for a 100 wRC+ over the last five years) and Carlson might also be able to play a situational center when the Cards are behind and need offense, as well as some first base. That versatility is valuable icing on a switch-hitting cake.

His swing looked much different than all the other kids'. At the time I wasn't sure whether that was good, or if I thought it would work in actual pro games. I've seen other high schoolers hit balls much harder and farther than he did at that age, but I still haven't seen anyone scoop the ball in the air with that kind of consistency in a derby or BP setting. And now Kirilloff -- despite missing 2017 due to Tommy John, and after dealing with recurring right wrist issues that tanked his offensive output in 2019 then being unable to rebound statistically in 2020 because of the pandemic -- was asked to make his big league debut during the playoffs and is likely to be handed an everyday role in 2021. The departure of both Eddie Rosario and Nelson Cruz means the Twins need two more big league lineup cornerstones, and Kirilloff is the by far most likely internal candidate to be one right away. 
Healthy Kirilloff is going to hit and hit for power. Part of why I was skeptical of his swing in high school is because he strides open, his front foot drifting way down the first base line rather than back toward the pitcher. This allows him to turn on balls most hitters are jammed by, but he still has the plate coverage and swing path to lift contact the other way when pitchers work away from him. Ironically, Eddie Rosario's swing worked in a similar fashion, and the two are also similarly free-swingers. I was skeptical of Rosario's at the time (incorrectly), and he doesn't have the kind of power Kirilloff does. A thickening build has slowed Kirilloff down, and he's now spent some time at first base after beginning his career in CF/RF. I think we'll see him play a combination of first base, right field and DH depending on the starter the Twins are matched up against on a given day. Corner bats who like to swing as much as Kirilloff does can be pretty risky, but I have a high degree of confidence in this one because he tracks pitches well and sprays hard contact all over the place. I think he's going to be a 3-ish annual WAR, middle-of-the-order anchor. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","l3xPPnRQA7o","20325"

Then in late August, he was shut down with a forearm strain, the first real blemish on what had been an immaculate track record of arm health (his 2018 IL stint was due to an oblique injury). Manning has publicly downplayed the severity of that injury and has been healthy and throwing all offseason without issue. We'd rather he have been totally healthy, but this injury doesn't seem severe enough to alter his stock. 
All of the physical components that many front-end arms have while they're in high school were present when Manning was an amateur -- shooting guard frame, premium arm strength and athleticism, a breaking ball -- and remain so today. He has pretty good feel for location and balance for a young 6-foot-6 guy who takes such a gargantuan stride off the mound, and that should continue improving with time and reps. Manning starts on the extreme first base side of the rubber and has a cross-bodied, drop-and-drive style delivery that creates flat angle on his fastball, which gets on hitters quickly. And Manning goes right at hitters with that fastball (60% in-zone rate in 2019), which has the cut/carry traits typical of a power pitcher's fastball. His arm slot is much different now than it was in high school, a testament to Detroit's dev group and Manning's ability to make adjustments without a drop off in on-field performance. Since entering pro ball, his walks have come down, Manning's changeup has gotten better, and he started working with two different fastballs and was clearly manipulating the shape of his spike curveball depending on the hitter and situation in 2019. Now he's working on a second breaking ball. Assuming the forearm issues are behind him, Manning has front-end starter ceiling and will likely make his big league debut in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","k-sipbEctAU","sa917924"

There are going to be some strikeouts but Witt is a big, athletic specimen who is very likely to not only stay at shortstop but be quite good there. He also has a swing geared for pullside lift (he can bend at the waist to go down and yank balls away from him, too) and the power to hit balls out even when he swings a little flat-footed. He is the son of a former big leaguer and carries himself like one, which has endeared him to scouts and coaches during the course of a high-profile amateur career laden with very high expectations.

His approach in Dominicana was bad, and his swing's front foot variability, which Eric wrote about last year, was gone. Julio is now a bucket strider: he strides open like he's trying to pull everything. Some hitters can do this and still manage to really get their arms extended to cover the outer half of the plate (Eddie Rosario, Alex Kirilloff), and Rodríguez absolutely has the strength to do damage the other way if he turns out to be this kind of hitter. But he swung inside an awful lot of well-located sliders in LIDOM. Not nasty sliders -- a bunch of fringe big leaguers and indy ball guys pitch in LIDOM -- just well-located ones, something there's no shortage of in the big leagues. He either needs to be in position to dive and spoil some of these, or just do a better job of laying off them entirely. The calling card power and makeup are still present, and Rodríguez's 35-plus homer, All-Star slugger ceiling remain the same. He also showed up for 2021 Spring Training having lost a bunch of weight and running a full grade better than he did in 2019 and 2020.

Though not likely to hit for significant over-the-fence power, mostly due to his approach rather than a lack of strength, Carroll whistles balls into the gaps and down both baselines, then kicks it into top gear very quickly and punishes outfielders slow to corral the ball by turning their lackadaisical fielding into extra bases. So exceptional are Carroll's hand-eye coordination and barrel accuracy, especially for his age, that he now has among the best hit tool projections in the minors. It's a skillset very similar to Brett Gardner's, except Carroll can play center field.

He was horrendous early the next season before he slowly began to throw more and more strikes as the draft approached. He's dominated opposing hitters since signing, amassing 212 strikeouts in 145 minor league innings before his 2020 big league debut. Until he set foot in the big leagues, Skubal had some relief risk because he was working with his fastball at a bizarre rate in the minors. His delivery looks like a pterodactyl is trying to throw a baseball, and it forces hitters to deal with a very strange look and angle, as well as big velocity and carry at the top of the zone. So unhittable is Skubal's heater that he's struck out 37% of hitters during his minor league career (48% over the final few weeks over Double-A play in 2019) while throwing the pitch roughly 70% of the time. No current big leaguer with a fastball that plays at the top of the zone throws their fastball that much, and anyone close to 70% is a sinkerballer. 
During his initial 2020 big league trial, Skubal was quite wild early on but, just as in his draft year, he slowly started to work more efficiently toward the end of the summer. His changeup (which has lateral action but almost no sink, which is sort of bizarre) and slider are now clearly his best non-fastball weapons, though he can only reliably throw the fastball for strikes. In addition to some of the visual command problems, Skubal's release point is highly variable. Because he has such a nasty mix of stuff, and because he has shown a slow, but relevant command progression in the past and seems to be doing it again, we're still inclined to project Skubal as a mid-rotation starter rather than the highest-ranked reliever on this list. He'll generate amazing rate stats early in his career but probably won't work deep into games, but he has top-of-the-rotation ceiling if he can develop better command. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","bcoy-xb3kJY","22267"

How could we have collectively anticipated that he'd transform from a light-hitting speedster shortstop into a multi-positional physical freak with a rare power/speed/patience combination? I submit that Bruján shares all of Marte's pre-breakout traits (and has a lot in common with Ozzie Albies, too) and could take a similar leap in his mid-20s, as he progresses further into physical maturity. Like Marte, Bruján is a top-of-the-scale athlete and one of the most electric in-the-box rotators in all of the minor leagues. There are lots of other players whose measurable height and weight read as ""small"" who simply don't have Bruján's body composition (he's angular, tapered at the waist rather than built like a stick), musculature (you can see his lats through his jersey), or explosiveness. I think he has room to add mass even though he's short, and that he's likely to because he's a dedicated worker, which means some indeterminate amount of power will arrive with time. 
I also think that he'll continue to harness his hellacious swing, which, based on his contact rates, he already has abnormal control over. I've watched Bruján swing so hard that he corkscrewed himself to the ground, only to pop back up like a Russian folk dancer, but even though he swings that hard, he has good feel for contact and ball/strike recognition, enabling him to grind out tough at-bats and walk a bunch. Let's re-examine the statistical case. Bruján split 2019 between Hi- and Double-A and while his walk rate took a bit of a dip at those levels, his on-paper performance was still well above league average (.277/.346/.389 with 48 bags in 61 attempts, and 28 extra-base hits in 100 games) for the Florida State and Southern Leagues. His exit velo data from 2019 is not great, but remember I'm betting on more of that arriving later. There are scouts who think he can play shortstop, but I think the arm is a little light for that and instead think he'll be play a combination of second base and center field. As I've passed around the early iterations of my Top 100 list for industry feedback, most have told me I'm at least a little too high on Bruján, which I think is useful for readers to know, but I'm sticking to my guns on this one because I think he has a chance to be a star. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","UBXDU4EcKOo","sa872786"

Though he struggled with walks after he moved into the Aggies rotation in 2019, Lacy whiffed 130 hitters in just 88 innings. He was less wild in his brief 2020 four-start jaunt prior to the shutdown, punctuating his pre-draft run with a 13-strikeout game against New Mexico State and fellow top five pick Nick Gonzales. 
Lacy presents scouts with a non-traditional mechanical look that makes his delivery appear pretty violent about his head and shoulders, even though he has less of a head whack now than he did in high school and as an underclassman. While his delivery creates some perceived relief risk (he'd be one hell of a reliever), there is none regarding the pitch mix. Lacy's arm slot creates backspin on the fastball that enables it to have big carry at the top of the zone, his slider has remarkable length for how hard it is, and when Lacy gets on top of his curveball, it has huge, bat-missing depth. The delivery also disorients hitters who take lots of bad, awkward swings at pitches that live in the middle of the zone. His changeup (which Lacy sets up with a two-seamer) occasionally looks good, and might be a real out pitch if it's re-emphasized in pro ball; I thought it was his most polished secondary weapon when I saw him in high school, though I don't have any delusions about it becoming his best weapon now since his breaking stuff is so good. Kansas City seems to have eyes on competing and they've pushed their college draftees lately, so it's possible Lacy will move very quickly.

He showed above-average power, some bat control, and improved agility behind the plate, boosting his stock to the late first/early second round of the draft. He didn't catch much velocity in high school and struggled receiving pro arms at first, but that has improved to a place of acceptability. More importantly, he's continued to hit.

Recall that Miami brought him back gingerly in 2019 after he had an injury-riddled '18; he first dealt with neck/shoulder issues, then elbow, then neck/shoulder again. Shoulder issues once again popped up during 2021 spring training and have run into the start of the regular season. These issues are part of why I'm a little lower on Sixto on the overall top 100 than the public tends to expect. The other reason is because of his fastball's shape. Some of my previously-held concerns about the playability of Sánchez's fastball (it's really hard, but only generated an 8% swinging strike rate on its own against 2019 minor leaguers; the big league average on all pitches is 11%) were allayed by him developing a second type of heater. He now has a pretty well-defined four- and two-seam variants, and good arm-side command of the two-seamer. In aggregate, he still missed bats at a rate just below league average, but he also generated a ton of weak groundballs with his fastballs, so I still consider the pitch to be plus.
His changeup, which had been one of the better ones in the minors for a while, will continue to be his primary out pitch. It has bat-missing, screwball action, so much that it dips beneath the barrel of right-handed hitters as well as away from lefties. Sánchez can also run it back over the glove-side corner of the plate for looking strikes. Though his slider has plus spin, the shape and quality of its movement are variable and location-dependent. Sánchez's command, especially for someone who throws as hard as he does and who converted to pitching later than most others, is pretty advanced, and if he ends up with plus command of three good pitches (one of them great), he'll likely make some All-Star teams, but he slides just a tad because of his injury history and because I don't think his fastball can dominate consistently even though it has elite velocity. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","OFHkPmNCPOI","19680"

Remember that we're talking about a small school pop-up reliever who, due to a past shoulder injury and the pandemic, has just one full pro season as a starter. Howard has impact stuff. His changeup is plus, he can blow his fastball past lefties near their hands, his slider has big time action to his glove side, and his low-70s curveball is a nice look to present hitters the second and third time through the lineup. His breaking ball lacked backfoot angle in 2020 but, based on how Howard has described his shoulder issues impacting how he pitched, that may come if he and the Phillies staff can find a way to put the shoulder problems in the rearview. There are three or four bat-missing pitches in Howard's bag when he's and loose. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","hEr3iNdRJmg","23252"

Pleasant HS (TX)","It sometimes feels foolish to ""wait for things to click"" with very talented but frustrating (and perhaps flawed) prospects, but that's what it seemed like was actually happening for Kopech just before he blew out his elbow late in 2018. The surgery's timing meant Kopech lost all of the 2019 regular season and began rehabbing in a game environment during Fall Instructional League. His first bolt was 99 mph. He settled in at 96-99, and threw several plus sliders. Kopech made his spring 2020 debut on March 10 and threw 11 pitches, six of which were 100 mph or more. It was his only inning of 2020, as Spring Training was shut down soon after, and Kopech would later opt out of the season amid the pandemic and other meaningful off-field considerations. As such, his evaluation is the same.
Kopech's trademark heat and slider give him late-inning potential even if he can't start, an outcome that seems more likely during the early part of his big league career now that he's missed two seasons and may take time to build up an innings load. He'll be able to start if he can command that slider to the back foot of left-handed hitters; he needs to have an out-pitch against lefties and some sort of viable third pitch, which I think will more likely be a second breaking ball than a split or a changeup. If he can do that, I think he's a 3-to-4 WAR starter. <em>(At-home dev)</em>","JXUYoulUEo8","17282"

Healthy Bleday was not only one of the more polished hitters in his draft class but one of the most physically gifted as well. In addition to having a superlative feel for the strike zone, Bleday is also short to the ball but still creates lift. He murders offspeed stuff, has all-fields ability, and can mishit balls with power -- a complete offensive package. He's also pretty fast, and his instincts in the outfield could make him a plus corner defender. I expect him to move pretty quickly and be an above-average everyday player.

Larnach remains a sluggish, diffident outfielder, but he's very likely to get to much of his titanic raw power in games thanks to the ease with which he generates the pop -- Larnach doesn't swing with violence or effort, it's just there -- and a refined approach. His swing is a little more compact now than it was in college but Larnach will really get extended on balls away from him and punch them the other way.

Last year, he was again up to 96 but sat 91-94, about the halfway mark between his peak and nadir as an amateur. Considering how readily pitchers lose velo in pro ball, that's still a win for Seattle. Even though it only sits 93-94, Gilbert's fastball is his best pitch, and the way he most effectively whiffs hitters, though maybe his changeup will show some late development. While all of Gilbert's secondary pitches are average and flash above, I think his command will enable them to play above their raw grades, which, combined with what the innings count could be because of his frame and how efficiently he works, will still make him an above-average WAR generating starter. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","l0Jw6egZzJg","sa3008598"

During his pre-draft summer, Greene was a little soft-bodied, his running gait was odd, and he seemed destined to play little more than an average outfield corner. The player scouts watched the following spring had a better physical composition, was more explosive and a better runner, and had as ripe a high school hit tool as was available in the draft. This was similar to how Jarred Kelenic's skills were colored as he came out of high school. 
Greene's swing, curated by his father from an early age, is beautiful. He can clear his hips and turn on just about anything on the inner half, drop the bat head and lift balls with power, strike balls the other way with authority, and he tracked and whacked many high school benders. The bend and flexion in Greene's front knee as his swing clears the point of impact is reminiscent of several Dodgers hitters. Though there are many examples of Greene having certain types of athleticism (he is a tremendous leaper, for instance), he's not a runner and we don't have him projected in center field. But we think he'll hit enough that it doesn't matter. Though he started a string of high-upside early 20-somethings on this year's top 100, his skills are more comparable to those of the polished college draftees in their mid-20s who are slightly ahead of him there because they're further up the minor league ladder. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010694"

The players who surround him on that leaderboard -- Luis Arraez, Eric Sogard, and David Fletcher -- are all similar offensive players who make elite rates of contact but have almost no power. More precisely, Madrigal is most like Arraez because of how opposite-field oriented their contact is. If you prorate Fletcher and Arraez's performance over the past few years, they're pretty well above-average players, and Madrigal is a better defensive player than Arraez and is a wash with Fletcher at second. I just think this reinforces the industry's long-standing eyeball evaluation that even though he's quite small and is not going to hit for power, Madrigal is a very good player. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","tQxQekapA8k","20521"

He struck out a lot (again) during the 2018 stretch run, when St. Louis pushed him to Low-A Peoria because he wasn't being challenged in Johnson City. Sent back to Peoria for the first half of 2019, Gorman adjusted to full-season pitching and roasted the Midwest League to the tune of a .241/.344/.448 line, cutting his strikeout rate by eight percentage points. He was promoted to the Florida State League for the second half, and while his walk rate halved and his strikeout rate crept above 30% again, Gorman still managed to post an above-average line for that league as a 19-year-old. His strikeout issues will only become a real concern for me once Gorman stops showing an ability to adjust over a long period of time. 
His huge power, derived from his imposing physicality and explosive hand speed, is likely to play in games because of the lift in Gorman's swing and his feel for impacting the ball in the air. Because we're talking about a teenager of considerable size, there's a chance he has to move off of third base at some point, and now that Nolan Arenado is in town, St. Louis will see how Gorman looks at second and in left field. I bet he'll be able to make routine plays on balls hit to him at the keystone, but I have no idea what he'll look like operating around the bag.

Some area scouts thought he was so raw as a hitter, and that his stock had fallen enough due to a pre-draft hamstring issue, that he might be better off going to school. The Cubs took him in the second round, tweaked his swing, and skipped him over a level; he responded by hitting .305/.381/.525 at South Bend, and he may just be scratching the surface. 
Davis was his conference's Defensive POY on a 2016 state championship basketball team and he didn't fully commit to baseball until his senior year of high school. He has a big, projectable frame that he's already added a lot of muscle to over the last year and a half, and amateur scouts raved about Davis' maturity as a student and a worker (often citing the odd hours he keeps taking care of a goat and the llamas at his family home), and all thought he'd be able to cope with likely early-career contact struggles and would work to improve his ability to hit. Watch out for the injuries here. In addition to the hamstring issue in high school, Davis was on the IL twice in 2019 for hand ailments. We only have a 50-game sample of stats, but it's just evidence supporting the athletic/makeup foundation and reinforcing that the swing change worked. This is a risk/reward power/speed outfield prospect.

Even though he's clearly gotten stronger (he's still listed at a comical 166; I felt I had to manually adjusted a bunch of listed weights in this system), Mauricio simply doesn't have the pure explosiveness of someone like Marco Luciano or Bobby Witt Jr., and while he might continue to get bigger and stronger, and add power that way, I don't think he'll end up having thunderous raw. There's still a pathway to stardom here; Mauricio is a switch-hitting shortstop with pretty good feel for contact after all. He'll need to refine either his swing or approach to be an everyday player, and probably both to be an impact one. Because he's so young, there's time for that to happen.

Kristian Robinson is among the most talented and prominent of those affected. After parts of three years in the warmth and security of the complex, it was time for Robinson to go to full-season ball and perform, and start to reinforce the tools- and frame-based excitement he had generated as a teenager. Instead Robinson spent another year sequestered in Scottsdale, too green to be part of the D-backs official alternate site group until he was added later in the summer. By the time Fall Instructional League rolled around and scouts were able to see him, Robinson looked rusty. He took poor at-bats and struck out a lot while missing hittable pitches in the zone.  But if any player, at any level were to struggle for a couple weeks, it'd easily be dismissed as a brief slump or tough-luck dry spell rather than a true regression, and that's even before considering the individual player's context. Robinson's 2020 was supposed to be about making adjustments to full-season pitching and getting his swing to a place that would allow for more in-game power. Instead it meant an entire year away from competitive baseball, a whole year away from home, an unspoken indication from the org that he had been passed by Corbin Carroll (who was invited to the alt site group immediately), and more monotonous developmental ball during instructs. 
Let's not lose sight of the foundation here: Robinson is built like a young Larry Fitzgerald, and he entered pro ball without the same kind of performance track record as most of his Dominican peers but still received the fourth-largest bonus in his signing class because his tools are so huge. In 2019, he hit 50% of his balls in play with an exit velo of 95 mph or more, which is up in Joey Gallo/Nelson Cruz territory. It is not normal to see a person like this on a baseball field, and Robinson has uncommon potential because of it. The questions that need answering here are the same as last year: Can Kristian turn a suitable swing foundation into one with impact, and can he perform against more advanced pitching? He'll hit 35-plus bombs every year if he can. For now, he fits in the Top 100 continuum near the 55/50 FV line, along with several other prospects of extreme variance and ceiling. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","U24cWc3kkog","sa3006884"

Martin's performance, especially late during his 2019 sophomore season, put him at or near the top of the 2020 draft class. He slashed .392/.486/.604 that year and, similar to but perhaps not as emphatically as Adley Rutschman the year before, asserted himself as his draft class' top college hitter. Then Martin came out for the shortened 2020 campaign and though his numbers (against mostly non-conference pitching) were strong, he did not look elite from an eyeball scouting perspective. He wasn't running as well as he had the year before, and he had issues throwing the ball from third to first base, necessitating a move to center field. The industry didn't have much time to assess his routes and instincts there before the shutdown, and his average early-season speed created some skepticism. During his career at Vanderbilt, Martin mostly played third (61 games), but also saw time in center (25 games, half of those as a freshman), and at first (22) and both middle infield spots (14). He continued playing all over the field during his post-draft time at the Blue Jays' alternate site. The low-end pre-draft opinions of Martin feared he'd end up in left field and that he'd be without enough power to support an everyday profile there. I think he's likely to play a couple different positions at a passable level, at least one up the middle (either second or center), and the portion of his offense that drove his amateur stock, namely his elite plate discipline and feel for contact, will carry him to production on par with an above-average regular, à la Ben Zobrist.

Alek Thomas' frame reads as Lilliputian on paper, but in reality, he's quite strong and has one of the more athletic swings in all of the minors. Since he was drafted, Thomas' swing has evolved to mirror the intensity of prospect-era Cody Bellinger's, and sometimes Thomas swings so hard that he looks like he's going to corkscrew himself into the ground. His leg kick is a little bigger and slower now than it was when he was an amateur and first-year pro, and his stride is longer, which might help him avoid cutting down at the ball so much. The change to his swing and his approach -- Thomas was once an all-fields spray sort of hitter but was trying to pull the ball constantly during my instructs look, though maybe he was just bored -- could allow for more in-game power. 
The foundation of Thomas' prospectdom was his advanced baseball acumen and feel for contact, both of which were surprising for a cold weather prospect. But he was good enough to play in several upper-class events as an underclassman during his amateur career, and he performed in those consistently. He tracks pitches well and moves the bat head around the zone, and those underlying skills as well as Thomas' athleticism and (unlike Bellinger) shorter levers help enable him to take these new, huge hacks without striking out a ton. Some underlying 2019 metrics indicate Thomas indeed needed a swing tweak to unlock some in-game pop. He averaged just shy of 90 mph off the bat in 2019 and about 48% of his balls in play came off at 95 mph or above, but he ran a groundball rate of nearly 55% and some proprietary, Statcast-y expected stats I've sourced indicate he overperformed on paper in 2019. But, as I tend to do, I'm betting on a) athleticism and b) feel to hit, both of which Thomas has shown for nearly a half-decade now. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","Bo9Wh47-Wm4","sa3006892"

He showed up in Bradenton sitting 94-97, continuing the climbing velocity trend he began to exhibit throughout his senior spring in 2019. He went from showing a lot of 91-94 during his pre-draft summer to sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, then settled back into the 91-95 range the summer after Pittsburgh made him the first high school arm selected in 2019. 
He added a considerable amount of strength over the last year and a half, and has also made some subtle mechanical changes. His glove has migrated north during his gather, his arm swing isn't as long, he's clearing his front side better, and he lands with more control and balance in his blocking leg. I'd understand some hesitancy to alter one's evaluation of someone like this based on the context of the look, since Priester had most of the year off and came out throwing just a few innings at a time in a very controlled environment, but because the uptick in velocity has been coupled with physical and mechanical changes, I'm more inclined to believe it's real. And perhaps I've buried the lede here: Priester has one of the nastier curveballs in the minors, and maybe in all of baseball. He had feel for creating shape on his breaking ball in high school but it wasn't nearly as hard as it is now, nor was its movement as sharp, vertical, and vicious. It comes out of his hand high and then crests and drops with the curvature and angle of a waterfall of seams and leather. It has Adam Wainwright's curveball's shape but is harder, and Priester is going to use it to embarrass a lot of big league hitters. He had some changeup feel in high school and now that he's wielding huge arm strength, that has backed up a little bit. I'm betting that will improve as he gets starter's innings in 2021. His delivery is still somewhat violent and arm-y but it's better now than in high school, and he has less command-based reliever risk than other pitchers toward the back of the Top 100.

To a degree those remain reasonable, though they're no longer applicable across nearly as much of Lewis' skillset as they once were. Initially, those comps came from his penchant for on-field leadership, his swing's finish (though he's way more pull-oriented than Jeter was), his frame, and, less positively, his future as a defensive shortstop. The Twins took him first overall in 2017 and cut a below slot deal, as Lewis was seen as one of five options in a tightly-packed top tier of talent. 
Throughout his first 18 months as a pro, Lewis had statistical success while being promoted aggressively before a developmental hiccup in 2019. His overall production has slowly come down at each subsequent level, and during a 2019 season split 3-to-1 at Hi- and Double-A, he had a .290 OBP. Then came a robust .353/.411/.565 Arizona Fall League line (he went to pick up reps after an oblique strain during the year) and League MVP award. But in Arizona Lewis still clearly had issues. His swing is cacophonous -- the big leg kick, the messy, excessive movement in his hands -- and it negatively impacts Lewis' timing. He needs to start several elements of the swing early just to catch fastballs, and he's often late anyway. This also causes him to lunge at breaking balls, which Lewis doesn't seem to recognize very well. All of this is bizarre in context, as an advanced hit tool was a huge driver of his amateur profile, but Lewis now looks like a guess hitter. His mannerisms -- Nomar-level batting glove tinkering; deep, heavy, deliberate breaths between pitches; constant uniform adjustment -- are manic, and they seem to pull focus away from the task at hand rather than ground him in a ritualistic way, and the game often seems too fast for him. 
His swing looked the same during 2020 spring training but, based on a little bit of video sent to me by an executive from another team, appears to have been tweaked at the alt site. He's starting with an open stance now, and the angle of his bat as he sets up is also different (more north/south and away from his shoulder), but he still has that excessive leg kick and extraneous noise in the way his hands load. I don't think the swing works as currently constituted -- it's a mechanical departure from when Lewis was successful in high school -- but I think it'll get dialed in eventually because of his athleticism and work habits. Plus, we now have evidence that he's open and able to make adjustments. 
As the org stated he would in mid-March, Lewis focused on playing shortstop at the alt site. Their public desire to move Jorge Polanco around as a super utility type perhaps opens the door for him to get big league reps at short next year unless the Twins sign a stopgap option. I still think Lewis' eventual role will be that of a multi-positional rover who plays center field and a couple different infield spots. We won't know anything about whether his new swing has had an impact on his hitting until we have a sufficient 2021 performance sample, but as I said last year, I'm betting big on Lewis' makeup and physical talent. His BPs were the best in the entire Fall League. He is an exceptional teammate, leader, and worker, who did more early infield work than anyone else I saw in the AFL, willing himself to become a viable left side defender even though he lacks the traditional grace and fluidity for those positions. Even if some of the pitch recognition stuff proves to be a long-term issue, the floor here is that of a multi-positional role player who hits for considerable power. There may be an adjustment period similar to the one Javier Báez experienced early in his career because of the approach issues, but the star-level talent will eventually shine through. <em>(Alternate site)<em>","38ioTNwWePc","sa3004259"

His skillset is somewhere on the Chris Taylor/Javier Báez continuum of strikeout/power offensive profiles at a premium defensive position, though the low-end of his potential outcomes looks like Freddy Galvis: a plus-gloved shortstop who hits for power, but with an OBP around .300. 
I wanted to see another year of plus walk rates before declaring that to be a true part of the skillset (Chisholm walked 11% of the time in 2019, up from a career 8%), but the pandemic made that impossible and Jazz earned the everyday second base job in Miami with his 2021 spring performance. His power is real (a 91.4 mph average exit velo would put him in the top 40 of the majors, while 48% of his balls in play being over 95 mph would be in the top 30), the lift is there (he has a career groundball rate in the low 30% range and a 17 degree average launch angle according to a source), and Jazz is athletic enough to be a plus defender at shortstop. The contrast between Chisholm and the ultra-steady Miguel Rojas is very stark, and it will be interesting to see how Miami handles the dynamic there over the next couple of seasons. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","ir2kVOIT4mE","20454"

Garcia struggled in his initial 24-game, 68-plate appearance big league trial, hitting just .194 and striking out 38% of the time. The issue that plagued him was the same one he had in the minors: an inability to recognize breaking stuff. He paid for it more consistently against big league pitchers, who can execute consistently and exploit such a weakness. 
But let's not lose sight of the pretty incredible collection of tools here. Garcia has above-average raw power right now and I think he has the frame to add another half grade as he enters his mid-20s. He's also a fantastic shortstop defender despite middling speed and range (at least in 2020) because he has plus-plus hands, actions, and arm strength. He's going to backhand balls in the hole and throw out guys few other shortstops in baseball would be able to hose. Also remember that Garcia is about the age of the college players who were just drafted, and it would be ridiculous to expect even someone like Spencer Torkelson to skip Double- and Triple-A and immediately succeed. I think Garcia is going to end up punishing mistakes on the inner half with power and swinging at inside breaking balls away from him en route to a power/defense-driven everyday role, and he has long-term All-Star ceiling if his approach improves. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em> ","oe9MB7KStTA","23378"

At a certain point in time, the same was true of Kevin Maitan. That is the range of potential outcomes here, as we still only truly know about Dominguez's showcase tools (what it's like to watch him take BP and run, both of which are scintillating) and very little about how he'll perform against pro pitching. Because of how early and how covertly the Yankees and Dominguez agreed to a deal (New York spent all but about $300k of its initial $5.4 million international pool on him), few scouts have seen him at all, and even fewer have seen him against quality live pitching, although that number has started to creep up as he participates in live BPs in the Dominican Republic. The mystery and intrigue, rare for elite, contemporary teenage athletes because of the prevalence of social media video, and those slick Yankees pinstripes have created a fever pitch of expectation for Dominguez in both the real world and the baseball card finance bro space. 
Last year, when Dominguez was close to near the top of the 50 FV tier (where he'll remain), one scouting director told me he is impossible to evaluate for a list like this, while a former GM told me he was too low. It's hard to find switch-hitters with power like this, let alone ones who already have usable swings from both sides of the plate at this age. Dominguez got very jacked in 2020 and looked more like a Mr. Universe competitor than a baseball prospect. Not everyone digs this, and it's discussed with the same tone of captivation and alarm as Zion Williamson's size and explosion. There's no precedent for someone this age being as big and strong as Dominguez already is, but nobody is sure what that means for his long-term athletic viability. I'm probably more comfortable ranking someone like this highly than a GM would be acquiring him for equivalent value, but it's possible that, a year from now, Dominguez will have become unacquirable. He's the highest-variance prospect in baseball, and maybe the highest-variance athlete in sports. <em>(DR Instructional League)</em>","x6cbWcITk7Q","sa3014696"

Defensive versatility is valuable on its own, and this was also a logical trial given Cleveland's situation at the corner spots. Carlos Santana has departed, the club's outfield was below replacement level in 2020, and one of the better hitters on the planet is already the club's third sacker. But regardless of the circumstance, there is a contingent of scouts who think Jones has already outgrown third base. He's stretched two additional (listed) inches since high school and now stands in at a long-legged 6-foot-4. Though his ridiculous arm enables him to make some tough plays, Jones' size has an impact on his defensive footwork and mobility. 
But ultimately, it doesn't really matter where Jones plays, because he has a special offensive skill set that will likely profile anywhere. Not only does he have big raw power, but Jones has perhaps the best strike zone discipline in the entire minor leagues. He ran a 20% walk rate across a 100-game sample as a 21-year-old at Hi-A, then posted a 14.7% rate at Double-A (he had turned 22 by then) to wrap up 2019. Jones has the highest walk rate (17.9%) the last two years among minor leaguers who have reached at least Double-A, and there are only five other hitters his age or younger who are within three percentage points of him. That patience combined with high-end raw power (he has the fourth-highest max exit velo among prospects on The Board) that Jones hasn't yet totally tapped into should enable him to be a cleanup-hitting force. 
There's some platoon-y, strikeout risk here. Jones struck out a lot his short Double-A trial and then in the 2019 Arizona Fall League. He's not good against left-handed pitching and will need to be dropped in the lineup against lefties, and sometimes come off the bench. But again, Jones has elite feel for the zone and huge power. His skillset is a scaled down version of Adam Dunn's or Joey Gallo's, and quite similar to Pat Burrell's (other than the handedness). <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","S1tP3qEVSW8","sa917941"

His hands work in a circle that enables him to turn on and lift pitches down-and-in, and helps him scoop breaking pitches with lift, but also in a way that causes his bat head to drag through the zone a bit. After watching Carter Kieboom struggle with a similar-looking swing, I've begun to wonder if Downs will be tied up by big league velocity in on his hands. But the closer to the bottom of the zone pitches are, the more Downs punishes them with pretty good pop to all fields. He's going to pepper the gaps and do a fair amount of damage to right-center field. 
Last year, I projected Downs to be a second baseman based on how thick his lower body already was at age 21, and there are folks in the industry who still think that's the case, but at the alternate site, I thought he looked agile enough to stay at short and be passable in the same way Xander Bogaerts kind of has been, especially on balls in play to his left and in on the grass. I think Downs can be positioned defensively so that he's making most of his plays in that direction rather than having to go into the hole and backhand balls, which he's less able to do. His average exit velo was 88 mph in 2019, and there's not a lot of room on the body, so that might be all, but he strikes the ball hard and with consistency, and that's typically enough to be an everyday player at one of the middle infield spots. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","613T5IEJ7rk","sa3004615"

And he does have a pretty advanced approach and ball/strike recognition for someone his age, and also has enough pure strength to hit balls with power even though his approach appears conservative on its face. Because he's such a big guy with long, left tackle arms, his swing does have a hole up-and-in that will be difficult to close.

A college catcher, whose profile is driven by power and defense, goes in the top five but is rushed to the big leagues before his bat is ready, which has potential long-term consequences for his upside. Bart had only seen about a month's worth of at-bats above A-ball before the Giants decided to promote him. He did very well in those 32 games, hitting for huge power at Double-A during the final few weeks of 2019, then for the first two weeks of the 2019 Fall League, until a fractured his right thumb ended his season. In that narrow window of health we saw glimpses of Bart's power with physically fit phalanges. Whether he'll get to his power in games is now in doubt since Bart struck out in 42% of his big league plate appearances in 2020. He was both chasing and missing in the zone at higher rates than the big league average. This comes after 550 minor league plate appearances with a paltry 6% walk rate. Should we have seen an approach red flag here? Bart walked at a 10% clip in college.
With new questions about his bat, Bart's defensive tools become the foundation of his skillset. He's Mike Alstott's size but with the lateral quickness and ground game of a small-framed catcher. He's quick out of his crouch and throws accurate lasers to second base. He also has field general qualities: he's a rousing, vocal leader at times, a calming presence at others. Still likely to be an everyday catcher, Bart's ceiling is now dictated entirely by how much of his power he can get to in games. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","Cozg_YSvag0","21524"

From last year: Things may finally be starting to gel for Lowe, who has had tantalizing tools since high school. He was a power/speed prep bat without a clear position, but most of the amateur half of the industry assumed he'd be able to play center field if not shortstop or third base, where he played in high school. He quickly moved to the outfield and has played almost exclusively in center since 2017. He isn't great there, but most of Lowe's other abilities have been slow to develop, so it's possible his feel for the position will come later, too. For instance, Lowe has big all-fields power but has been strikeout prone since his prep days. Once he began playing pro games and generating data, however, it became clear that, despite the whiffs, he had a great idea of the strike zone. The raw power didn't really show up in games until Lowe's batted ball profile began to shift in 2018. His groundball rates were in the mid-40% range until that year but slowly began shifting downward. Then Lowe had a breakout statistical 2019 as a 21-year-old at Double-A. 
He's always going to strike out, but he's also probably going to keep walking a lot, especially now that the power is a real threat. It's pretty important that he stay in center field to take some pressure off of the hit tool. If he can do that, he'll be an everyday player. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","FpeotjI5qYU","sa917926"

Then McKenzie was living in the 93-96 range in his first start and leaned on the fastball in big spots, often shaking off Roberto Pérez to get to it. Over the next few weeks, McKenzie's velocity dropped in each subsequent start before it spiked again in a long relief role at the very end of the season. You could argue the injuries and fluctuating velocity are indications that the long-held industry apprehension regarding McKenzie's durability has turned out to be correct. But it also would have been unreasonable to expect any pitcher to hold their velocity as they got deeper into their first extended action in quite a while. The action on McKenzie's fastball also gives it some margin for error, velo-wise. And both his slider and changeup have evolved to complement the fastball/curveball combo that had headlined his arsenal as a younger prospect. Even though it's still unclear exactly where his fastball velocity band will sit during the course of a whole season, I think McKenzie has the necessary other components to pitch in the middle of a rotation. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","SaiUEE5AOzQ","18000"

Jeffers took to this style and answered some of the defensive questions he faced in college, when it was unclear if he'd catch or end up at first base. Eyeball evaluations of his receiving are still mixed but according to my sources (and not just ones with Minnesota), the framing metrics in the minors were good, and they were very positive during his month-long stay in the big leagues last year when Jeffers was thrust into the lineup due to Mitch Garver's injury. 
So long as he can stay back there, Jeffers is pretty easily an everyday player. He has average bat-to-balls skills, above-average thump, and the ability to hit the ball in the air consistently. He essentially made the leap from Hi-A to the big leagues in 2020 and hit .273/.355/.436. I think it's fair to expect the Jeffers will experience a BABIP regression in 2021, but I think we'll see his strikeout rate (which historically was close to 20% and was 30% in his initial big league trial) come down, too, which will help balance that out. His athleticism, breaking ball recognition, and, perhaps most importantly, plate coverage are all a tick below average, but I still think there's enough offensive ability here for Jeffers to profile as an everyday catcher. Garver's presence could impact Jeffers' playing time, and since most of Jeffers' defensive value is tied to his receiving, his overall career production might be front-loaded due to the looming possibility of electronic strike zones. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"24618"

I think it's fair to wonder simply because Garcia hasn't done it yet, but I'm more inclined to dismiss arguments focused on his size. I wrote last year that, because part of the formula for torque (which could theoretically be used as a measure of stress on the elbow) is the distance from the fulcrum, that longer-armed, usually taller pitchers might actually be more of an injury risk than a little guy like Deivi. But having watched Garcia go about his business at the big league level, I'm backpedaling his FV by a grade, since I think his power-pitcher's approach will make it tough for him to work as efficiently as he'll need to in order to log the aforementioned sort of innings total. 
Marcus Stroman sets great precedent for smaller pitchers like this, but while Garcia is really well-put together and athletic, he's not quite the elite-level on-mound athlete that Stroman is, and Stroman's stuff works in such a way that he gets one or two early-count grounders every inning, while Garcia just doesn't pitch like that. Instead, Garcia's tries to sneak 91-95 past hitters at the top of the zone. The angle and spin axis of his fastball helps it play up, but it isn't a plus pitch. His 12-6 curveball is beautiful, but can be easy to identify out of his hands because of its rainbow shape, so even though it has what I'd consider plus-plus depth, and plus spin, it also plays more in the 50/55 range. Garcia's changeup, which has about 12 mph of velocity separation from his fastball, is likely to become his most effective secondary weapon, and he already has great feel for locating it. His slider's shape is similar to his curveball's, just with more velocity. The entire repertoire is either average or a shade above it, and I think Garcia will end up working around 140 innings and generating 2-ish WAR annually. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","TtDspHp7TRI","20276"

He's 23 and hasn't played above A-ball, but is still a pretty stable prospect, in part thanks to his coming of age in LIDOM. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League, LIDOM)</em>","YRrhsdBsxBo","sa876320"

He added strength to a contact/defense foundation and his exit velocities moved very close to major league average, which was impressive for a 19-year-old. Peraza got some reps early during big league spring training before heading home for the summer. He then played sparingly for Cardenales de Lara in the Venezuelan Winter League. There he showed a modified stance and hand set-up, but he played so little that it's hard to say how it might impact his quality of contact without more looks and/or data to support it. I do think he'd benefit from taking a longer stride, though. Either way, this is a contact-oriented shortstop who'll likely be an above-average defender, maybe better than that. I have conviction in the hit tool due to Peraza's curt, short swing, his visible barrel control and his track record of hitting as a young-for-the-level player so far.

Suitable range bolstered by his instincts, and plus feet, actions, and arm utility make him a potential plus defender at short. His feel for the strike zone and bat-to-ball ability from the left side of the plate (his right-handed swing is bad) will be sufficient for low-end everyday duty, but relevant power might be coming. Perdomo's exit velos climbed throughout 2019. He averaged about 80 mph off the bat at Low-A, then about 82 mph after his promotion to Hi-A, and finally averaged 87 mph during a limited Fall League sample. His body has become more mature, and his left-handed swing has become more explosive and now features an overhead, helicopter finish similar to Miguel Andújar's even though Perdomo's physicality really hasn't changed at all. There's still some room for improvement as it relates to his lower half usage in the swing, and it's possible Perdomo scraps hitting right-handed altogether at some point. The skills/instincts foundation here is solid enough to project Perdomo as a low-end regular, and the burgeoning physical ability means he's begun to look like more than that. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","wS1NAke5r2E","22799"

My previous research into shortstop size has shown that most teenage prospects gain about 30 pounds between when they're 18 and 21 years old, which puts Marte's baseline body projection in the Willy Adames/Trevor Story realm, at about 210 pounds, assuming Marte's current listed weight is correct. I'm inclined to think he'll end up north of that just based on how big and imposing his frame has already become before he has turned 20. If only because of what improved defensive positioning allows, there's Goldilocks Zone power/defensive spectrum potential here, as Marte already has enough raw juice to put balls out to all fields, and will probably have at least a full grade more at maturity. His TrackMan power metrics (they're over on The Board) are in the 40/45 range right now because Marte's swing elements are not always well-timed. They are, however, very athletic. The big leg kick (which Marte is balanced enough to utilize), the little bit of bat wrap to create some loop and lift, and the ability to move the barrel around the zone are all encouraging swing elements, but we really don't know a lot about Marte's bat-to-ball skills right now because he hasn't really been seen or generated stats against good pitching yet. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","24XWJlBKDh0","sa3008745"

(Major league teams were skeptical of that explanation and thought his absence had to do with an off-the-field matter.) In that lone appearance this spring, Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 with his fastball while flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams valued him leading up to the draft (the relief risk, the injury or makeup issues) was highly variable. Their confidence seemed to be determined by who in the org had seen him and when (many teams weren't able to get a decision-maker to see him in person in 2020), but those that focused on his pitch data, which was shared among all the teams, thought he had among the best raw stuff in the entire draft class and was one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen. Crochet was also among the high-octane college pitchers thought capable of going straight to the big leagues in a relief role, something more broadly considered by clubs due to the structure of the 2020 player pool. Out of Burl Carraway, Clayton Beeter, etc., only Crochet actually did. 
After he tuned up at the alternate site for about two months, Crochet was added to the 40-man and sent to the big leagues in mid-September. He pitched six innings in five relief appearances, walked no one (though he was pretty wild if you put on the tape), allowed just three hits and no runs, and struck out eight big leaguers. He made the White Sox playoff roster but left his first career postseason outing with a flexor strain, which ended his season. He's healthy now, training and throwing at the team's complex in Arizona. Because he barely threw in 2020, he's likely to be on a strict innings limit in 2021. The club is going to try to thread the needle here and use Crochet in a relief role while still trying to develop him as a long-term starter. Players in this situation tend to wind up in the bullpen, and that's where I have Crochet projected based on his strike-throwing limitations, independent of his shortened developmental timeline. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","SQKYGiObDos","27463"

But there is skepticism surrounding his long-term athletic viability because Kirk is a very husky guy (listed at 5-foot-8, 265) without a body comp precedent in baseball, or arguably across all of pro sports. Because Christian Vazquez is listed at 5-foot-9, 205 (which is either an embarrassing oversight or an intentional lie), the closest measurable comp to Kirk is José Molina at 5-foot-10, 250, but that's from when Molina was nearly 40-years-old, whereas Kirk is only 22. It's very difficult to anticipate what might happen to his frame as he enters his mid-20s, when many other players are thickening up as they reach maturity. All of this creates doubt surrounding whether or not Kirk can catch right now and/or long-term. But because he made his major league debut in 2020, we've gotten to see him do it a handful of times, and for a lot of different pitchers, at the big-league level. Kirk's receiving and framing are okay. He catches on one knee even with runners on base, which makes him especially good at framing balls toward the bottom of the zone. He sets his target then lets his glove hand go slack and works back to the ball as it heads home, which magnifies issues with visual presentation to umpires when his pitcher misses his spot. In general, Kirk just has a slow-moving glove and doesn't catch pitches at the top of the zone as cleanly as the softy sinkers at the bottom, and I wonder if he'll have more obvious issues catching power arms, though he did fine in two outings as Robbie Ray's backstop. Kirk's legs set up as wide as they can go when he's in his modified crouch so he can try to block balls without actually having to move his whole body laterally, and it actually works okay. He's not a great thrower despite an average arm because he's so slow out of his crouch, and sometimes he'll throw from one knee to circumvent this. 
My visual evaluation is that he's a passable defender, not a good one, and I think the Jays deep stable of catchers will dictate that he DHs sometimes and catches at others. The more 1B/DH Kirk has to play during his years of team control, the less valuable he'll be. He has an all-fields, doubles-oriented approach that prioritizes contact and walks, which I think is great for a catcher but won't be at first. He's an everyday big league catcher right now, but he may have an abnormally early decline phase. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"22581"

That's a 4% walk rate, and in Kirby's most recent calendar year of innings, it has been a microscopic 1.3%. While his pre-draft velocity was strong (touching 97, often 93-95 early, 91-94 late in starts), his secondary stuff was very average. His slider and curveball (the latter is better) ran together a bit, and his changeup had inconsistent finish. But often elite command of what is a 55-grade pitch in a vacuum leads to elite results (see: Bieber, Shane), and I think that sort of secondary pitch effectiveness is possible for Kirby. 
One of Seattle's stated post-draft goals for the right-hander was to make him stronger. In 2020 spring bullpens, Kirby looked noticeably thicker and stronger, and he is indeed throwing harder, touching 99 mph several times in Peoria side sessions. Then Kirby sat 97-99 throughout his time at the alt site. The context of the look is important, but the velo bump coincided with a change in physicality, so I'm more inclined to believe it, or something approaching it, will hold. Even with fairly vanilla secondary stuff, mid-90s heat and Kirby's potential for elite command gives him a mid-rotation ceiling. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3011526"

The nearly two-year layoff hasn't caused me to downgrade Groshans so much as he has just been passed by hitters in whom I have a higher degree of confidence. The tools package here, arguably a Josh Donaldson starter kit with similar swing mechanics, still gives Groshans a pretty huge ceiling if he can actually hit like he did for the first month of 2019. He's a big-framed, well-made athlete with enough arm strength and mobility that some teams thought he could be tried at shortstop in pro ball. Part of that is because his arm strength might enable him to hide some of what he lacks in lateral range, and he did moonlight at shortstop at the alt site.

It'd be foolish to construct a new opinion of his offense from an eight-game statistical sample but it was instructive to watch him catch most of a big league staff during those three games behind the plate. 
Stephenson catches on one knee with the bases empty, then from a crouch with runners on. For most fastballs, his glove works from the middle of the plate outward, and for breaking balls he typically works from beneath the zone, up. The latter is more effective from a pitch-framing perspective, but both approaches are fine from a receiving standpoint, which was an issue for Stephenson as a younger prospect. So, too, was ball-blocking. Stephenson is 6-foot-4 and his wickets are pretty big. His legs often get down late when he has to block a ball, but they're so long that he ends up having good lateral range by using his length to slide around. Even then, Stephenson mostly tries to use his glove to pick balls in the dirt rather than get his knees down and pads over the ball, which may affect pitcher confidence in his ability to block balls. Stephenson avoids tipping pitches with runners on base. His legs bow out wide when a breaking ball is coming, but it happens too late for the baserunner to signal the hitter. I suppose we don't know how well he will be able to block the nastiest of breaking balls, but I think he clearly looks capable of catching and will be at least an average defender with a big time arm. 
Offensively, Stephenson puts on quite a show during batting practice but has a contact-oriented approach in games. Per a source, he had one of the better in-zone contact rates in the 2019 minors, which is quite the opposite of how most of the amateur side of the industry thought he would develop as a pro. It's possible he eventually makes an adjustment that unlocks more in-game power, but I think a contact-first approach that derives power from Stephenson's strength is still plenty for him to profile as a good, everyday catcher. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","HDhq33FljWA","17988"

Even though he's only 20, I consider Rocchio a high-probability everyday big leaguer by virtue of his advanced feel for contact and exceptional shortstop defense. So fundamentally sound is Rocchio that Cleveland was willing to give him some big league spring training reps each of the last two years, when he was still just a teenager with mostly backfield experience. He looked comfortable, both in the field and at the plate, in that handful of games. He has great range, hands, footwork, and just enough arm strength for the left side of the infield, since it's enabled by the quickness of his actions. Rocchio’s 2019 triple slash line at Mahoning Valley (.250/.310/.373) is not all that impressive at first glance, but it was enough for a 107 wRC+ at the level, and he was just 18.

He has much better feel for contact than all but a few players in the minors, let alone the catchers. It has allowed Ruiz to get away with an overly-expansive approach. He swings at far too many pitches outside the zone, but he is so often able to get the barrel there that it hasn't mattered, and he's a .299 career hitter in spite of this. While Ruiz makes remarkably consistent contact, it's not all that hard, and he's unlikely to hit for more than doubles power in the big leagues. But I think even a one-dimensional, contact-only offensive profile like Keibert's is enough to catch everyday, and while I consider him a capable defender, it's worth noting that some clubs do not. 
Ruiz has baby soft hands and is a great pitch-framer and receiver, but he's a casual, low-effort ball-blocker who'd much rather rely on his hands to pick balls in the dirt than be mobile and throw his body in front of the baseball. I think his hands are so good that he'll get away with this, but others think it impacts his pitchers' conviction in throwing breaking balls that finish in the dirt. Arm-wise, Ruiz's slow exchange drags his pop times down, but he's very accurate and I'm starting to think that so long as one has sufficient arm strength, accuracy might matter more than the pop time. But again, this is not a universally-held belief.

Instead, Balazovic arrived at the alt site in September and looked his usual self, sitting 92-96 there, which is the top end of his velo band from 2019. 
He throws strikes with four pitches, several of which either project to miss bats or do so right now. Chief among them is his fastball, which is tough for hitters to pick up out of Balazovic's hand as they're misdirected by his limbs flying all over the place during the delivery. Even with a somewhat lower arm slot, Balazovic's heater plays at the top of the zone. He can vary the shape of his breaking balls -- the slider is the out pitch, the curveball gets dropped in for strikes -- and both play up against righties because of the mechanics. And while Balazovic's glove-side slider command should be enough for him to deal with lefties eventually anyway, his change improved in 2019. He throws an unusually high number of strikes for such a young, lanky, cold-weather arm with a somewhat violent delivery, and he's had no health or control issues thus far.

His frame filled out and his velocity became more consistent start to start, resting in the 95-99 range and touching 101 throughout 2019. Duran also worked with better angle after the Twins acquired him, a change that improved the playability of his breaking ball without detracting from his changeup's movement, though that pitch seemed to be de-emphasized in 2019 even though it looked promising to my eye while he was with Arizona. His curveball will have more obvious humpback movement when he throws it for a strike, and has more two-plane tilt when he's trying to bury it down and away from righties. 
I'm doing something a little different with Duran's pitch data over on The Board since I've become aware that he has two very different types of fastballs, a four- and two-seamer with an unusual spin difference between the two. Duran works downhill rather than with flat angle, so I think the two-seamer (the org calls it a ""splinker"", as in splitter/sinker, and I have this pitch graded in the splitter column on The Board) will be his better fastball, and even though that pitch has the lower spin rate, it's the one you'll see represented on The Board. That amount of demarcation in spin and movement makes Duran a four-pitch starter prospect with elite velocity and fastball characteristics that will lead to less swing-and-miss than you'd expect given his velocity, similar to what Sixto Sánchez and Brusdar Graterol have exhibited during their respective big league tenures. Duran's delivery is very upright and kind of stiff, and he doesn't have pinpoint feel for location, instead just living in and around the strike zone enough to start.

Because Hall's release is inconsistent, not only did his walk rate regress in 2019, but the quality of his secondary stuff was also less consistent than it was during his very dominant mid-summer stretch in 2018, when his changeup clearly took a leap. Both of his secondaries are often plus; Hall simply has a higher misfire rate than most big league starters.

But his lack of impact contact was, for the first time, noted as a real problem by scouts who saw him in the Fall of 2020. As with Nick Madrigal, Luis Arraez and other players like them, I think hitters with a complete lack of power can still be good everyday players provided that they make a nearly elite amount of contact, and to this point Edwards has. Like Franco, Edwards' 2019 swinging strike rate was just 4.8% (he just doesn't put the ball in play as hard) and his track record of hitting in games extends way back to his underclass high school days. At one point, I thought Edwards could be a slash-and-dash Luis Castillo clone, but he doesn't have the samurai-level feel for contact Castillo did. I still have a high degree of confidence in his bat. All of Edwards' extra-base damage will be done down either baseline, as he'll sneak grounders past the corner infielders and be at second base in the blink of an eye. The Rays plan to deploy him as a multi-positional catalyst, a speedy, Chone Figgins-style player.

It makes sense for the Dodgers to keep working with him at second base, just in case he can get good enough to actually play there some of the time. I did not have an extended look at him in the Fall but the scouts who did think he could eventually be passable there, but definitely not good, much like Tommy La Stella. Busch played the keystone for an extended stretch on the Cape in 2018 but spent his career at North Carolina playing mostly first base and some corner outfield, and those are the two positions pro scouts think he'll move to if second doesn't work out. 
But most importantly, Busch really hits, and is probably an everyday player even if he ends up mostly playing left field. He's patient, tracks pitches well, and has big, strength-driven power. I consider Busch a high-probability big leaguer who could have some years of star-level WAR output if he can play second semi-regularly. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","2A597xbLtFA","sa3011540"

They have similar builds, their hitting hands work in a similar, aesthetically-pleasing loop, and like Hiura, Gonzales also faced questions about his ultimate defensive fit, albeit for different reasons. The altitude at New Mexico State (Las Cruces is 3,900 feet above sea level) aided his offensive output there (he had a .399/.502/.747 career line), but his 2019 Cape Cod line (.351/.451/.630 with wood bats against great pitching) carried a ton of weight in draft rooms, and it certainly didn't hurt that in the weeks leading up to the COVID shutdown, Gonzales went on an epic heater and homered 12 times in 16 games. 
Despite the huge power output, Gonzales' offensive skill set is more well-rounded, and he's also been described to me as ""a good hitter with some power"" rather than a middle-of-the order force of some kind. I don't think he has the barrel accuracy or striking power of Hiura, but Gonzales is really difficult to beat with velocity in the strike zone and has the strength and plate coverage to drive fastballs the opposite way. He'll also scoop and yank hanging breaking balls toward the left field seats, but the home run pop here is more mistake-dependent than it is a constant worry for opposing pitchers. He'll need to become more fundamentally sound around the bag at second to stay there (I think he'll initially play shortstop in pro ball but move to the keystone relatively soon), but if he can then Gonzales pretty comfortably profiles as a solid everyday player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","ERjO24Hja8Q","sa3014510"

Instead he pitched manicured innings at the alternate site, then did some remote development before instructs, where Espino did not throw in games due to a minor shoulder injury. This comes after he was only allowed to throw one or two frames per outing for his first several pro appearances, then three to four for his final few -- Espino sat 94-97 and touched 99 with two plus breaking balls and starter's command during those. Whether he retains that level of heat over an entire season's worth of innings on regular rest (he was 92-97 in longer starts before the draft) we simply don't know, but there's no reason to think he is any more of an injury risk than other teenage pitchers unless you twist your brain into knots and conclude that his velocity is somehow a negative, or that he strength trains excessively. 
His arm action is atypical and quite long, similar to Madison Bumgarner's, but it works for Espino. If, like Bumgarner, Espino loses some velocity even before he reaches the majors, be it due to a pro workload or injury, I think he has a command-centric, four-pitch strike-thrower outcome.

You can't fake an 11% strikeout rate, though, which was especially impressive considering he made that much contact as a teenager in full-season ball. Even though he is young, I thought it was unlikely Moreno would develop much more raw power, both because catching takes such a physical toll on the body that it often dilutes offensive production, and because Moreno is a smaller-framed young man. But his max exit velos at the 2020 alt site were up above what they were in 2019, which appears to be the result of added mass rather than a swing alteration. It's an encouraging sign and part of a pretty impressive 2020 for Moreono during which he was seen on alt site video, during instructs, and then later in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he hit .373/.471/.508. I think the length of his year is as close as any catching prospect has come to being forced to replicate an actual full season behind the dish in 2020.  Defensively, he catches on one knee until there are runners on or there are two strikes, then sets up really wide in his crouch regardless of the pitch coming, which prevents runners from being able to signal pitch type to the hitter. He can sometimes be preoccupied with framing and whiff on a pitch he should be able to handle, but he's a capable if unspectacular defender and framer. Even with the little extra juice, Moreno's offensive profile is still all about hand-eye/bat-to-ball, punching airborne contact to all fields. He does enough of that to project as an everyday catcher. The Jays were compelled to add him to their 40-man this offseason, and he's one of five catchers they have rostered, making Moreno a potential trade chip if the competitive Blue Jays want to add to their roster. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional league, Venezuelan Winter League)</em>","IZ-QYT1uaCQ","sa3003226"

He went wire to wire as one of the best prep prospects in his class from basically his sophomore year on. He was drafted second in the 2017 class as a pitcher, and he began dominating in his first full season (especially with his fastball) as he was allowed to go deeper into Low-A games in May and June of 2018, which culminated in a seven-inning shutout (2 H, 0 BB, 10 K, and all in just 69 pitches) on July 2 against Cleveland's affiliate, and then a legendary Futures Game appearance during which he sat 99-102 in front of the whole world. Eleven days later, Greene's season was over. He had a PRP injection and rehabbed, but he ended up having surgery in April of 2019 and did not pitch in a live setting again until he was at the Reds' alternate site during the pandemic. 
Perhaps the individual baseball timelines least-impacted by the pandemic were those of injured pitchers whose years were already going to take a predictable shape in a rehab and development-focused environment. By throwing in California and then at the alternate site, Greene performed some facsimile of what he would have otherwise done in 2020. But it will still be nearly two years between when he last threw a pitch in a minor league game and when he will again, delaying and complicating the arc of a very talented prospect. Here's another complication: Greene's arm slot is now lower than it was before he got hurt. Significantly lower. His arm slot now looks more like it did when he was in high school, creating tailing action rather than carry on his fastball. It might impact how well his fastball plays, even though he was throwing really hard at the alt site, but we won't really know until he's made some 2021 minor league starts. The new-ish slot has also aided the action on Greene's breaking stuff. He's added a former cutter/slider to his original, slurvy breaker. The layoff and change in mechanics add degrees of variance (and probably added relief risk) to a profile that already included a lot of it, but I ultimately have faith in Greene's combination of elite ability and seemingly strong desire to be really good, so I continue to project that he will be. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","tKAAzmpe180","sa3005315"

He had iffy freshman and sophomore seasons but flashed a tantalizing blend of stuff and feel at times, keeping him in the first round mix despite inconsistent performance. As a junior, everything clicked for him during a heavily-scouted, early-season college tournament in Houston, where Lodolo worked in the mid-90s with a plus breaking ball and changeup and struck out 13 Houston Cougars in seven innings. He'd end up posting career-best numbers across the board and was drafted seventh overall in 2019. After the draft, Lodolo pitched a total of 18 innings between Billings and Dayton, his fastball resting in the 92-94 range.  
Lodolo threw in one pre-shutdown spring training game and in one summer camp tuneup, and neither went well. He showed up to summer camp looking kind of soft and with diminished velocity, and he paid for it early on in a scrimmage against the Tigers during which he surrendered back to back to back homers and couldn't make it out of the second inning. Lodolo slowly began rebuilding arm strength throughout the summer and was back into his usual range by the end of his run at the alt site. His arm slot is abnormally low for a starter but when he's throwing well, he has great east/west command of his fastball and can back door his curveball for strikes on the arm-side corner of the plate. He still needs to more consistently bury that curveball in the dirt for swings and misses; to my eye it looks like it should present tough angle for righty hitters when it's located to their back foot. While Lodolo would sometimes go entire outings without throwing many changeups as an amateur, there were stretches when it was his best pitch, and the cambio was a developmental focus at the alt site. The entire package reads like a suitable fourth starter. When Lodolo is in shape, his frame is ideal, his delivery elegant and repeatable. The stuff isn't dominant, but some teams are still projecting on it because of how big and lean Lodolo's frame is, which makes them think it might be eventually. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","iUFDfzPzh74","sa917947"

He was absent from the alternate site and instructs due to an extended bout of myocarditis, a heart condition that's often a side effect of viral infection (though Kjerstad isn't known to have tested positive for COVID-19), and can impact long-term heart health. <em>(At-home dev, injury)</em>","m8q8iZiuC60","sa3014439"

He did not throw during Feb/March spring training and instead joined the team at the summer tuneup camp and then at the alternate site in Port Charlotte, where his velocity (according to a source not with the Rays) was more in the 93-96 range, which is where he pitched as a starter during the 2019 regular season. This could be because he was working as a starter at the alt site (he was back to throwing four pitches there, as the changeup came back) or because he was told to dial it down and throw more strikes, or because adrenaline doesn't really flow when nothing is on the line, or some combination of these factors.

Offensively, Walls is a switch-hitter with great feel for the strike zone and for squaring balls all over it. He's kinda stiff and really doesn't have much power because his swing is so simplistic, instead punching a lot of liner singles over the heads of infielders.

Well, it did. I saw Jung a few times in college and again after he was drafted, and while he struck balls with authority, he was inside-outing everything to center or right-center field and couldn't really get around the baseball to pull it, even during batting practice. While Jung's strength and feel to hit enabled a high quality of contact despite this atypical style, there are just times when it's best for hitters to turn on middle-in mistakes and park them in the left field seats or rip them down the line for a double, and I finally saw Jung start to do that in the Fall of 2020. He was a .346/.452/.562 career hitter at Tech and had more walks than strikeouts during his last two years with the Red Raiders. Originally thought to be a risk to move to first base, Jung has not only allayed those concerns but also played a passable college shortstop and deserves an extended look at second base in pro ball to see if he can do it. He's 23 and still hasn't played above A-ball because of the pandemic, and his 2021 season got off to a delayed start because of a stress fracture in his left foot (he was still in a walking boot as of mid-April).

That pitch has indeed improved and will likely be his putaway offering in the big leagues. 
That may surprise readers aware of his curveball's reputation. Indeed, Liberatore's curveball has all-world depth, but I think its results may suffer because he doesn't have an up-in-the-zone four-seamer to pair with it. Instead it's the sort of pitch I think he'll use to get ahead of hitters late in outings, dumping that curveball into the zone for strike one. It's the type of pitch that's hard to hit even if you know it's coming, but might be easy to lay off of when Libby tries to bury it in the dirt, because its Loch Ness Monster hump is easy to identify out of the hand. All of the advanced pitchability stuff -- Libby started learning a slider during his senior year of high school, he varies his timing home, and he's likely to pitch backwards with his breaking balls -- is here, too, and that'll be important given the lack of a bat-missing fastball.

He's also remarkably strong in the hands and wrists for someone his age, and in 2019 produced exit velos above the big league average. Peguero cuts down at the ball and is currently groundball prone. His swing may get longer as his attack angle changes. I think he'll end up a 55 bat with mostly doubles power.

Elite velocity carries Marquez's profile. His heater averaged 95.6 mph in 2019 and was parked at 97.8 in 2020, and there are only a half-dozen lefties on the planet who throw that hard. Marquez walked 13% of Low-A hitters over 17 starts in 2019 but was promoted to Hi-A anyway because he was just bullying hitters with heat and not really refining anything else. The Cubs have tried to get his lower- and upper-halves to synch better in the hopes that it will help him pepper the zone more consistently, and there have been fits and starts where it looks like things have clicked only to regress, similar to the way Phillipe Aumont's consistency did during his prospect peak. Marquez's changeup has bat-missing action and his arm slot makes his slider tough on lefties, though it's not a good pitch in a vacuum and both of his secondary offerings are typically dependent on location. There really aren't big league starters with this kind of build (especially at this age) and lack of athleticism, but there also aren't many pitchers who throw this hard.

He can hit balls out with a flick of the wrist, even when he hasn't taken his best swing. His speed under way and defensive instincts give him a chance to stay in center field, which would obviously give Pages a little more margin for error as a hitter. If he stays in center, he has a star-level ceiling. If not, then he has a whiff-prone, traditional right field profile driven by obvious impact power. Even if the latter occurs, it's very likely Pages not only gets to all of his raw power, but might outperform it because of how often he's able to lift the baseball.

He is also a converted infielder who only began pitching recently, in Johnson's case during his sophomore season at Louisburg College (the Hurricanes), where he threw just six innings with a fastball that mostly sat in the upper-80s. He then transferred to Campbell, and it was during Fall practices there that his fastball touched the mid-90s and he flashed a plus breaking ball, instantly making him a high-priority look for the following spring (2019) when he was draft-eligible. His stock and performance peaked in late-March of his draft year, then dipped closer to the draft when he failed to get through five or more innings in five of his last eight starts. The Rays took him in the sandwich round and Johnson was only sitting 91-95 in 30-pitch outings after he signed, but remember that he had barely thrown the year before and was pitching more than ever before. 
The pre-draft dip left room for questions about his season-long durability, and those remain relevant after there was no opportunity for Johnson to answer them during a real 2020 minor league season. But he did show up at instructs sitting 92-98 (including entire outings toward the upper end of that range) and touching 99 with three secondaries that grade out well from a pitch data perspective. We don't yet know how Johnson will respond to a full season of innings as a starter, but he does have starter-quality repertoire depth. His slider (which sat 85-88 at instructs) and curveball both have plus raw spin (his slider's spin rate spiked once the Rays got hold of him), and Johnson has natural feel for killing spin and creating sink on his mid-80s changeup. There's some relief risk created by his delivery (his arm action is still long, and the Rays haven't tweaked his college mechanics at all) and lack of mechanical consistency, but he is a plus on-mound athlete who, again, has barely pitched. I'm comfortable projecting pretty heavily on Johnson's secondaries and command because of the context here.

He was just 1.1 innings shy of graduating off prospect lists entirely in 2019, and would have graduated in 2020 had he stepped on a mound even once, but a bout with COVID delayed his activity at the alternate site, and then shoulder discomfort, which had plagued him the year before, resurfaced once he began to throw bullpens. The situation is similar to Cardinals righty Alex Reyes', who accrued 46 big league innings before he needed Tommy John, which derailed his ability to pitch out of the rotation early in his career due to the rehab timeline. This injury is especially scary for McKay since part of the reason he peaked as a 60 FV was because he projected to throw a ton of innings and generate 3-plus annual WAR on the strength of his durability. Now it sounds like he won't be ready for the start of camp. 
His fastball only sits 90-94 and touches 96, which is pretty average, but McKay keeps it away from the middle of the zone where it can really be hammered and often ties hitters up with it because he locates so well; his swinging strike rate on the heater was close to 17% in the minors, so I think it'll play. His cutter command is arguably even better, and he peppers the glove side of the plate with it at will. Changeup usage was scarce in his 49-inning big league sample but I think it will be one of the focal points of his repertoire, perhaps usurping the curveball, which has a stronger visual evaluation than it does if you look at the spin data. It's a repertoire/command profile similar to that of a lot of good lefties (Hyun Jin Ryu, Mike Minor, Cole Hamels), though most of them are more reliant on the cambio than McKay has been to this point. He now fits in with other major league-ready, strike-throwing 2 WAR starters toward the back of the top 100, though he needs to slide behind the ones who will be ready for the start of the season, and the ones who are coming off an elbow injury rather than a shoulder. <em>(Alternate site, Injured)</em>","aCKSVKfZpv0","20186"

Rodriguez amassed 167 K and 29 BB over the 136.2 innings he had thrown in two seasons leading up to that point, and did so by relying heavily on his ability to locate a quality fastball and changeup. In the Fall of 2020, back on a mound and competing in a live setting for the first time in over a year, Rodriguez was once again up to 98, and sat anywhere from 92-98 during his instructs/intrasquad outings. That was enough for Texas to add him to their 40-man roster during the offseason. His arm action is still quite long even though Rodriguez is a short-armed guy, and his arm slot presents an almost sidearm look but without the same cross-bodied delivery typical of side-armers. Its approach angle and spin (both axis and rate) give it an odd combination of ride and tail that makes it pretty tough to hit, and it's weaponized by Rodriguez's east/west command. When Yerry was really carving up lower-level hitters in the low minors, before he first had a long injury layoff, his changeup had more arm-side movement and bat-missing tumble than when I saw him during the spring of 2021. Yerry's arm angle makes it really hard for him to get on top of his breaking ball and I don't love its angle, but it does move enough to miss bats and his glove-side command of it is quite good. It needs to be, because this type of breaking ball is the kind that gets crushed when it's left in the middle of the zone. 
I's really like to see a second breaking ball here, or at least a means to create better back foot angle against lefties, though it's a little harder to envision for a guy of this arm slot. He needs something he can work inside on lefties, either a cutter or a more traditional breaking ball with better back foot angle. Maybe that can be found by altering Rodriguez's spot on the rubber depending on the matchup. y. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","8-2tF4ZEJGw","sa918130"

Hunt got a $1.6 million bonus to keep him from going to Pepperdine, then put forth three solid, if unspectacular offensive seasons (.258/.341/.384) before having a huge breakout during 2020 Instructional League, during which he was suddenly hitting for much more in-game power. As a young pro, Hunt had a conservative in-game swing swing. He'd show you average raw power during BP but deploy a contact-oriented approach in games. His swing had virtually no stride, and he relied on strength to drive balls into the gaps for doubles, but that was it. Last Fall, Hunt's swing had more lower body movement and that, combined with another year of added body/strength maturation, makes him a much more dangerous hitter. I watched him park one halfway into the left-center field seats at Chase Field and he took Mason Thompson (who sat 96-99 that day) deep later that week, his second loud extra-base hit that day. He was one of a few buzzy Padres prospects (some of the others have also been traded) from the Fall, and he performed against a quality cross-section of pitching. 
Hunt's defense has backed up a little bit. He was catching on one knee, even with runners on base, and his footwork coming out of his crouch was inconsistent, which lead to inconsistent throwing accuracy. I've also seen him pop as low as 1.88 on throws to second and, despite his size, he’s agile enough and has sufficiently good hands to receive and frame big league stuff. I think the style with which Hunt catches will probably grow and change, especially as he shifts to an org that seems less inclined to put their catchers on one knee with runners on, and ultimately he'll be good back there. The thing to focus on here, though, is the potential power production from behind the plate, which now compels me to project him as an everyday player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ","3EsET9nsQpE","sa3004153"

He arrived at the Twins alt site later than their initial group (which was tailored to provide big league depth rather than develop prospects) and came in throwing 92-96 with two plus breaking balls, all of which is pretty standard for Canterino. But he also began to develop a changeup in the cross-faced style of Devin Williams, and that pitch took a huge leap in quality during his 2020 development. Of course, it's the Twins who initially tipped me to this development. But because they opted into sharing data from their alternate site, I was able to confirm with sources outside the organization that Canterino's cambio has improved, and now has better velocity separation from his fastball, as well as impact tail and fade. So now this guy has four impact pitches, and remember, he's always been able to locate his fastball consistently despite his R-rated delivery. Does that make him a starter? I think some of the superficial elements that make it appear he is not slide Canterino behind pitchers with comparable stuff but a more obvious starter body and delivery. But he has four potential impact pitches and hasn't had strike-throwing issues since his freshman year in college, so you can't just bucket him in relief.

He's undergone a few minor swing changes since entering pro ball, and the latest iteration features a wider stance and toned-down leg kick, and is a close bedfellow to Spencer Torkelson's swing. 
Long-levered, corner-only prospects like Vientos are extremely risky, and the way his strikeout and walk rates trended in 2019 -- combined with the possibility that he might outgrow third base -- has led to some industry trepidation regarding his inclusion on the Top 100. But I like that he's been able to make swing adjustments, and Vientos also put up an above-average statline in full-season ball as a teenager and has some of the most exciting, frame-based power projection in all the minors. He torched balls in 2019, averaging just over 91 mph off the bat and putting 47% of them in play at 95 mph or above, which, for context, is a 65 on the scale. And he still has room for another 20 pounds on the frame. Proprietary metrics sourced for this list indicate that even though he only slugged .411 in 2019, his expected SLG based on the quality of his contact was closer to .480. I've seen Vientos get on top of elevated fastballs and drive stuff the other way with authority in a way that's uncommon for a hitter with levers this long.

And that could be a very fast climb. Hernandez was perhaps the most dominant lower-level hitter in 2019, slashing .344/.433/.646 during the AZL regular season before going on an Arozarena-esque tear in the AZL and then Northwest League postseasons after he was promoted for the last week of Spokane's season. He slugged over .900 during his final few weeks in the org. The Rangers invited Hernandez to their alternate site in mid-September and he tuned up against advanced pitching there before getting most of his 2020 run at Fall Instructional League. Then the Rangers traded him as part of a deal centered around Nate Lowe early in the offseason. 
Heuristically, this is not the sort of prospect I like. Heriberto is a positionless righty hitter (and thus is often at a platoon disadvantage) far from the big leagues. But his on-paper stats, underlying TrackMan data, and my multi-year in-person visual evaluation give me a high degree of confidence that this might be a very special hitter whose hit and power combination will clear the high offensive bar in left field or first base. His little T-Rex arms enable Heriberto to be short to the baseball, but he's so strong and rotates with such ferocity that he still hits for power. I've seen him make mid-at-bat adjustments to quality offspeed stuff, swinging over a particularly good splitter only to recognize the next one, located in the same spot, and rope it into the left field corner for a double. He covers the whole plate (something that's gotten better since my first looks in 2018) but is tough to beat on the inner half because his levers are so short. Because he isn't an up-the-middle player, Hernandez is not the type of prospect with an elite-level WAR ceiling, but he has the talent to anchor the middle of an order as a hit/power combo bat. <em>(Rangers alternate site and Fall Instructional League)</em>","ADS4KB2jOhc","sa3005630"

He’s a big-framed (about 6-foot-4) switch-hitter who is athletic enough to stay on the infield. Players like this have a wide range of potential outcomes, with one being that their body develops in the Goldilocks Zone where they remain agile enough to stay at shortstop, and also become big and strong enough to hit for impact power. Though some teams have shown evidence of a philosophical shift in this area, prospects like Preciado are the ones who typically get paid the most money on the international market. 
When Preciado came to the States for 2019 instructs, he looked like you’d expect a 16-year-old his size to look: raw and uncoordinated. He still had not gained athletic dominion over his frame, and he looked much more like a third base defender than a shortstop. Fast forward a year (because there was no minor league season) to the Fall of 2020 and Preciado now has a batting stance and swing that look an awful lot like Corey Seager’s. It allows him to be relatively short to the baseball despite his lever length, and whether it had to do with the swing change or not, he looked much more comfortable in the box this Fall than he did last year. Because of the missing minor league season, most teams in Arizona brought an older contingent of player to instructs than they usually would, and still Preciado (who is still just 17) was striking the ball with precision and power from both sides of the plate when he made contact. He had real issues recognizing breaking balls during the Fall and his ability to adjust to those will be key moving forward, but I'm willing to bet it was a symptom of him being 17 and facing unusually advanced pitching after not having seen any live pitching at all for much of the year. I still think he ends up at third, but there’s rare hit/power combination potential here and it just takes confidence in one’s eyes to see it might already have arrived.

Dingler checks a lot of boxes scouts look for in future big league catchers, combining size and strength with above-average athleticism for the position. He has a decent approach and solid hand-eye coordination, and some scouts see average or better power developing in the future after he hit five home runs in 13 games last spring; he entered the year having notched just seven over 102 games as a freshman and sophomore with the Buckeyes. Setting up with a slightly closed stance, Dingler’s swing can get a bit lengthy and uphill, leaving him susceptible to balls in the upper half of the zone, but he nonetheless projects as an above-average offensive contributor for the position. He needs to work on some of the physical intricacies of catching, but arrives to pro ball with all of the intangibles in terms of leadership and game management. His arm is plus, with consistent sub-2.00 pop times, but he can take some time to unfold his big frame and let it fly.

Mata resides in the 45+ FV tier for several of the same reasons that Adrian Morejon and Justus Sheffield have in the past: the shape of their fastball movement is not suited to missing bats, and they have a spotty command and/or injury track record. Even though Mata sat 93-96 as a starter in 2019, his fastball only generated a 6% swinging strike rate against mid-level hitters. His best two pitches for missing bats are his changeup followed by his well-located slider (the curveball has nastier movement but is an easy ID out of his hand due to its loopier shape).

He's now <em>only</em> a 70 runner who has a chance to lead off and play impact defense in center field. 
The news of the added weight and strength is exciting because, while Jimenez was already a 45+ on last year's writeup, he had little in-game power due to a very simple, opposite-field, slap-oriented approach, especially from the left side. There's been a little bit of movement on that score, but scouts still describe his swing as ""handsy"" and unlikely to produce power as it's currently constituted, again, especially from the left side. Both swings were previously concerning for several reasons (bat path, balance, varied lower half use) but it's possible that, even without a mechanical overhaul, Jimenez's increased physicality will enable him to hit for doubles power down both baselines and to the gaps, which would be perfectly suitable for both traditional and modern leadoff man archetypes so long as he has the requisite secondary skills. He has good natural feel for making contact thanks to impressive hand-eye coordination. And again, this is a plus-plus athlete with what the org thinks is plus-plus makeup, elite speed, and impact defense and arm strength. On top of all this, Jimenez led the college-heavy New York-Penn League in hitting as a 19-year-old primarily hitting left-handed, something he started doing just two years ago in Instructional League.

Scouts who have covered Houston the last couple of years count Solis among the most talented pitchers in the org and think he has as much upside as guys like Forrest Whitley and Bryan Abreu, if not more. He came out during 2021 spring training sitting 93-97 and during the course of four total innings against big leaguers, garnered at least one swing-and-miss with each of his pitches. He also struggled badly with his mechanical consistency and command, and the Mets varsity lineup shelled him. But remember that Solis is still just a 21-year-old who has barely pitched the last two years. If you line up his broad strokes age/stuff quality/relief-risk profile, it lines up pretty closely to LSU prospect Jaden Hill, who entered the 2021 season as a likely top 10 draft pick (he recently blew out). Solis should be close to a healthy Hill on the FV continuum. 
In addition to the mid-90s heat with vertical action, Solis has a power pitcher's overhand curveball to go with a firm, upper-80s slider and changeup. The movement he creates on the slider and changeup is mediocre-looking (note also that his 2021 spring spin rates, per Savant, were below my sourced numbers from 2018) but their shapes deviate enough from his fastball/curveball combo that they play well when located, which doesn't happen regularly yet. The fastball/curveball, meanwhile, have more margin for error due to sheer nastiness. While Solis has filled out during the last couple of years, his lower half is still weak, which impacts his delivery's consistency and his command.

Manoah can back foot his slider against lefties and his changeup flashed average in college, so he has a foundation of platoon-fighting weapons at his disposal, and changeup development was the focal point of his alternate site activity.

Because of his age and size, which portends an eventual move to first base in the eyes of many scouts on both the amateur and pro side, this is the type of prospect for whom statistical performance is rather important. In this case, we have very little of that. Baty showed advanced feel to hit as a prepster, then struck out a ton against age-appropriate Appy League pitching in 2019.

Not only has Baty kept his body in check but it's actually better now than it was in high school.

Video analysis of Baty at the alt site and in 2021 spring training, as well as a scout source's in-person look during the fall, indicate this is a guy with limited barrel precision, and that most of his offensive output is going to come from his advanced feel for the strike zone and light tower power.

He had trouble getting on the mound in Fayetteville in part due to his command, which still isn't great. Rutledge often worked 96-100 at San Jac, mixing in a comfortably-plus slider and a curveball that was closer to average. He would occasionally flash a good changeup, too, but that pitch was a distant fourth offering at the time. That's not really the case anymore, as Rutledge has hit the breaks on his curveball and spent most of 2020 focusing on his changeup, which had good fade and tailing action during spring training this year. 
There's clearly a starter's repertoire here, and potentially that of a very good one, but Rutledge has considerable relief risk because of his command and health history. Some clubs were scared off of his pre-draft medical, which most notably included surgery on his hip. He was a little wild during his 2019 post-draft summer, then spent 2020 behind the curtain of the alt site, and threw just one 2021 big league spring inning. It was a good inning, though. Rutledge beat up the outer half of the plate against all three batters he faced, relying heavily on his fastball, which sat 94-97, and touched 98 once. He also flashed a mid-80s slider twice, fooling the batter both times. He mixed in two changeups (which had fade but did not elicit swings), and his curveball (82) to lesser effect. He erased his only baserunner of the day with a quick pickoff move, catching the runner leaning at first, then made the rest of the batters he faced look uncomfortable and off-balance. 
Will he throw strikes consistently? Well, Rutledge was 6-foot-8 and 260 pounds in the past but looks considerably more svelte now and was listed at 245 this spring. Maybe that will help him better control his body/delivery. He already has a pretty short arm swing, so there's no low-hanging fruit to change there. He belongs in the back of the Top 100 purely on stuff, relief risk included, and is only just outside looking in right now because of short track record of performance and perceived injury risk. <em>(Alternate Site)</em>

He works with what amounts to four different pitches: a high-spin two-seamer that he works to his arm side, a four-seamer that he locates up and to his glove side, a nasty two-plane breaking ball, and a changeup. It's a slam dunk starter's repertoire in a vacuum, but Schmidt has one of the longer, gnarlier arm actions in baseball and already has one surgery under his belt. He also shows pretty significant release variation depending on pitch type, with his breaking balls coming from a lower, wider point while his fastballs, especially the four-seamer, comes from a vertical one. All of his release points viewed at once look more like a crescent rather than one tight, circular cluster. It's possible hitters will be able to pick up on this, but it's also possible Schmidt hides the ball so well that they won't. It's something we'll just have to learn by watching big leaguers face him.  The confluence of arm action length, release variance and injury history all create substantial relief risk here, but even if Schmidt ends up in a role of that sort, I think his repertoire depth will enable him to either close or work in a valuable multi-inning role. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"19899"

That the Yankees added him to their 40-man even though he wasn't at the alt site and decision-makers in the org had no traditional instructs to see is supporting evidence if you want to infer that they feel this way, too. 
The baseball gods gave Yoendrys Gomez a velo bump, which is like giving an Austrian composer a Les Paul. A year ago, Gomez was being described as a pitchability righty who could effectively vary his fastball's movement. Now he's touching 98. Talk of the fastball cutting and sinking has stopped and Gomez is now taking a power approach, working his fastball at the top of the zone in concert with a curveball at the bottom. He still needs a weapon to deal with lefty hitters and to repeat his delivery better, something that should come as his limbs fill out. And Gomez has sort of an odd build. His limbs are skinny but his trunk is not, and his shoulders are rounded and pitched forward. It's perhaps irrelevant because he is already throwing hard, but the build is similar to Jorge Guzman's, whose strike-throwing hasn't materialized. Last year, Gomez's stuff looked like it projected to be close to average but now he may end up with at least one plus pitch and the curveball has a shot, too. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3004650"

Gomez used the layoff to remake his body. He was a thick-in-the-middle 30 runner as an amateur, which is part of why he signed for just $600,000, but he was clearly a good baseball athlete. Instead of timed speed or visible strength, he displayed quick-twitch movement, first step quickness, lateral agility while ball-blocking, and hitting explosion through strength in his forearms, wrists, and hands. Over the summer he reworked his body, and has been working out in Miami with Aaron Judge, and he's now svelter but still plenty strong. A virtual lock to catch, Gomez has soft hands and is mobile behind the plate, and he has impact arm strength. 
While somewhat grooved, his swing is geared for in-game power, which gives him a chance to get to average raw pop. Purely from a talent perspective, Gomez might belong in the 50 FV tier (he's defensively similar to Drew Romo though I feel better about Gomez's bat, if you want to gauge where I think he'd go in a draft), but he's barely played in games and the attrition rate for teenage catching is very high. <em>(At-home dev)</em> ","UIUzPZR_djw","sa3008746"

Bailey's swing is minimalistic and effective. He can adjust his posture to help him cover the outer half and he's so short to the ball that he can catch fastballs at the top of the zone. 
Bailey's a fine receiver and blocker. He caught on one knee until a runner reached base in college (at least in my looks) but has been entirely on one knee (even with runners on) during 2021 big league spring training, splaying one leg way out to the side to act as a dam for breaking pitches in the dirt. Most of Bailey's good pop times rest around 1.95, which is about average.

He sent many non-conference pitches rocketing into Phoenix's midnight sky before he started seeing -- and swinging over the top of -- Pac-12 breaking balls. He was hitting .450 when PAC play began, struck out in 26% of his plate appearances, and finished hitting .342. Whether this was a real problem was the subject of many draft room debates, as was Bishop's relatively short track record of performance. Because the 2020 season was banged due to COVID, we still have very little quantifiable idea of how Bishop will handle a better cross section of breaking balls than he saw early in his junior year. He crushed middle-in pitches at the alt site but continued to waive at back foot breaking stuff. If he can indeed learn to lay off of those or drop the bat head and hit them, then he's going to be a star. 
Bishop has rare physical tools. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion, has solid feel for center field and huge, playable power. It's unclear why his arm strength dipped as a junior when it was an asset earlier in his career, but it's not a significant part of the skillset and I heard nothing odd about his pre-draft medical, so for now I'm looking the other way.

That meant he had to be seen when he pitched on the road. After he topped out at 94 during his pre-draft summer, Harrison was up to 97 in the Fall of 2020. This is not a traditional high school pitching prospect. Harrison has a prototypical frame but his delivery is an anomaly. He gets very low to the ground and takes a huge stride home, then throws two-seamers from a sidearm slot. The combination of the low slot and drop-and-drive style delivery creates a very low release point, and then flat, sometimes upward angle on Harrison's fastballs. He can create arm-side tailing action on his heater (to set up a precocious changeup) and also run it up the ladder. And of course because Harrison's slot makes him a very uncomfortable at-bat for left-handed hitters, and his curveball has the sweeping action most readers associate with a lower-slot lefty pitcher, that pitch is very likely to have at least some amount of utility. He looked like a sinker pitchability prospect during my high school looks but the spike in velocity and improved fastball utility raise his ceiling considerably. Now we're looking at a young prospect who had a pitchability foundation, albeit one with a strange look, experiencing a pretty significant velocity spike. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","1AlmnfSq0xE","sa3014513"

This, combined with his corner outfield defensive projection, makes him a prospect of extreme variance and risk since he'll need to really rake to be an everyday player. But he also tinkered with his swing during that pre-draft summer and at times it had ridiculous length and noise it's unlikely to once he has received pro instruction for a while. Plus, he was coming from Western Pennsylvania varsity ball, which is not nearly as good as that in the Southeast, Texas or California, which is where most of his opponents were from during the 2020 process. Let's also not lose sight of Hendrick's ability. He was the most explosive rotator in the entire 2020 class (and it really wasn't close) regardless of demographic, and carried among the biggest raw power projections because of his big, square-shouldered frame. He needs reps against good pitching, and time to adjust to what will likely be some initial failure. He got his first exposure to it during instructs and responded pretty well.

Except for a little bit of extended spring action, he missed all of 2018 with a broken arm and then lost a month of 2019 to an oblique injury. That has made it hard to evaluate his defense at length. I had him projected in left field last offseason but scouts who I spoke to regarding his Fall performance unanimously think I should keep him alive at second base, albeit as a below-average fielder there. I should note that several of those scouts came from orgs whose philosophy regarding infield defense is more inclusive than average. Regardless, it's fair to project on Bracho's defense because he hasn't had many pro reps at second base yet. 
What's important is that Bracho can really hit. He's stout and strong and hits balls much harder than is typical for someone with a frame this compact. He's patient and poised at the dish and clearly has an approach. He'll take giant hacks in hitter's counts and more measured ones when he's adjusting to a breaking ball or just trying to put a ball in play, though his swing looks a little long at times. His bat head can take a deeper path to the bottom of the zone but it's still usually on time because Bracho's levers are so short. He's quite polished for a hitter who won't turn 20 until near the start of the 2021 season. There's not a lot of body projection here despite Bracho's age. He's got a square, 5-foot-11-ish frame and is already physically mature. The lack of affiliated data here probably means the max exit velo listed for Bracho on The Board is less than he's capable of producing, and someone from outside the org told me they saw him hit a ball 450 feet over the batter's eye at the Reds place during a Fall game.

Arias was part of San Diego’s huge 2016 international signing class, inking a deal worth just shy of $2 million. He quickly became the most promising of the young infielders the club signed that year and was pushed to full season ball late during his age-17 season, well out ahead of the others in his class.

Arias looks like a stud at five o'clock when he's taking batting practice and infield, but his in-game swing decisions have been a problem, and were even during that statistically impressive 2019. The Padres threw every developmental trick in the book at him during the 2019-20 offseason, including virtual reality training, to try to get him to better identify balls from strikes, and chase less often. In a small spring sample, it appeared to be working -- Arias played some spring games in the place of Fernando Tatis Jr., who was one of several Padres to miss time with flu-like symptoms during the spring before baseball shut down. The importance of Arias' approach extends beyond his on base ability to his power production. His swing is grooved, making the parts of the zone where he can do real damage limited, so for him to get to his power in games he's not only going to have to recognize balls and strikes, but also learn what he can actually hit. It's possible this will occur, and Arias will be a star if it does, but I think an Orlando Arcia trajectory -- where there are growing pains and frustration amid flashes of spectacle -- is more likely. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","bzG6c8ZDi_g","sa3004047"

He stopped switch-hitting as a high school senior (he had good feel for contact as a righty hitter but was much less explosion than from the left side) and while many teams continued to prefer him on the mound, the Braves were one of the clubs that viewed him as a hitter, so blown away by his BP during a pre-draft workout that they didn't bother to ask him to pitch during it. 
After they picked him, Harris went to the GCL and raked. Not only was his on-paper performance fantastic (.349/.403/.514) but so was his underlying TrackMan data, as both Harris' average exit velo and hard-hit rates were well above the big league average. Remember that these numbers are still from 2019, our last minor league season, but Harris' average exits were top 10 among teenagers, and only one of those ahead of him (Liover Peguero) clearly has a better chance of staying at an up-the-middle defensive position long-term. 
Exposed to a fair bit of 2021 big league spring training, Harris has played well and produced some amazing individual highlights. He hit an oppo homer off of Peter Fairbanks and made a running catch in The Triangle at Fenway South. He may not be a long-term fit in center because we're talking about a compact young man with a very low center of gravity and a bottom-heavy frame who is rapidly approaching physical maturity. Conversely, this is a short-levered hitter with seemingly innate feel for making impact contact all over the zone, and while there may be a frame-related cap on his raw power projection, the hit tool might enable Harris to outperform his raw juice in games. 
The industry knows less about Harris because aside from PG National, he did not participate in the big showcases before his draft year, and his first full season was lost to COVID. There's a slice of the industry that thinks elite players just perform all the time, with any kind of extended failure or statistical hiccup evidence that a player won't be elite. If that's true then Harris is one of a handful of players who has a chance to be elite because he technically hasn't failed yet, in part because he's had fewer opportunities to. He's a fantastic athlete who has looked like a terrific all-around baseball player when he's been able to play, and he's gone from a third rounder to someone who we value on par with a mid-first rounder in the span of two years. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ","2_32n4WPIJw","sa3010684"

After a strikeout-heavy freshman year in Wilmington, Jones cut his whiff total nearly in half as a draft-eligible sophomore. He also improved enough defensively to keep the shortstop projection alive, though some scouts think he may need to move to center field. It was enough for him to be in teams' mix in the comp round's zip code, and he was drafted 31st overall by the Rays. 
A year and a half later, Jones remained the same sort of player. He struggled during Extended Spring, but had a strong summer in the Penn League, which was a pretty conservative assignment. Jones has everyday outs. Even if he doesn't stay at short, he's going to play up the middle, and so long as he's getting to the power he has a shot to play everyday.

I've updated some of the stuff related to his commitment's timing, but his scouting report is exactly the same: It's fairly common for a prospect's trade value to be affected by something circumstantial, but Song's situation is unique. He was clearly a first round talent ahead of the 2019 draft, but it was unclear where he'd be picked because of his military commitment. At the time, service academy policy stated that Song had to complete two years of Naval service, after the Trump administration repealed an Obama-era rule that allowed athletes to petition for an exemption in order to pursue pro sports or some other activity that might bolster recruitment or the military's image in general. Then, weeks after Song was drafted, the now-outgoing president reinstated the rule, with the exemption slated to take effect again in 2020. But Song's application for a retroactive waiver was denied by the Navy. He is eligible to apply for an early release in May. 
However long it takes, Song still has among the highest ceilings in this system. He works fast and throws hard, up to 99 during Team USA's late-2019 Premier12 scrimmages in Arizona, his slider is plus, and he will mix in the occasional knee-buckling rainbow curveball. He at least profiles in a high-leverage relief role given the current composition of his stuff and control, and perhaps more than that had he been put into the developmental pipeline more quickly. We can't anticipate what'll happen to his stuff because of the layoff.

His pre-draft spring was uneven but his velocity climbed as selection day approached, and he was 92-95 in a few outings just before the draft. Injuries (shoulder and oblique issues in 2018, then the TJ) and fluctuations in velocity (sometimes 91-93, sometimes 87-91) mixed with continued refinement of his secondary stuff. In addition to the overhand curveball he had in high school, Wentz has developed a fantastic changeup and it's become his best secondary pitch. So long as his velocity returns to normal, Wentz's fastball should play, as it has backspin and carry. The Tigers also seem to be pretty good at optimizing pitches and Wentz has only made a handful of starts in this org since being acquired for Shane Greene, so perhaps during rehab something about his breaking ball will change or tighten.

Some folks in baseball think he'll be a Justin Masterson-style starter, and perhaps he'll be put in that role as the Sox rebuild, but on a competitive team, I have Houck projected in a multi-inning relief role, and think his velo could climb to the top of that 90-96 band and touch above it in shorter outings.

He now starts with a narrower base than before, and his hands are set much lower to start, changes that theoretically create better rotation up through the kinetic chain and natural swing loft, respectively. We won't know if the changes have a substantive impact on Duran's power output until sometime in 2021, as his alt site hitting metrics are meaningless because they were generated against the same mediocre pitchers he saw over and over, but visually, it now appears Duran can better lift pitches in the bottom of the zone. He didn't exactly hit for power in Puerto Rico over the winter, though, and the org thinks it's because his new swing requires more precise timing, which Duran hasn't yet found. 
Still, let's not forget Duran's tools (he's a 70 runner) nor the foundation of statistical performance he has laid dating back to college. Duran hit a career .294 at Long Beach State but produced almost no power and slipped to the seventh round. Then he torched short-season and Low-A ball after signing, and began 2019, his first full pro campaign, with a ridiculous .387/.456/.543 line at Hi-A. But after seeing him at the 2019 Futures Game, I thought there was a gap between his talent level and that of the typical Futures Gamer, to his detriment. He posted a middling Double-A line during the back half of 2019, and he was similarly underwhelming during an extended look in that season's Fall League. 
Despite his speed, Duran's instincts in center field are still not good (though they've improved), and he relies on his speed to make up for what he lacks in off-the-bat feel and anticipation. It's possible the swing change has unlocked the power necessary to make Duran a regular, but it's also possible that it has de-stabilized his feel for contact. We won't know until he's generated a bigger statistical sample with the new cut.

As our own David Laurila learned from Seabold, he only began throwing his goofy, tailing changeup with his current grip/release in 2019, a year when he barely pitched due to an oblique injury. He picked up innings in the Fall League, where he looked a little out of shape but still sat 90-93 and touched 94 (typical for him) before being shut down again after just four outings. Then he threw at the Phillies' alt site in 2020 (publicly on video) before the team traded him and Nick Pivetta for Brandon Workman and Heath Hembree. 
Seabold doesn't throw all that hard but his fastball spins at an usually high rate for its velocity, and the pitch has flat angle and a spin axis commensurate with the modern, up-in-the-zone approach. The heater and the changeup, which has screwball action, are going to give hitters fits. Both of Seabold's breaking balls are visually mediocre but he commands them pretty well, and they aren't easy IDs out of his hand, especially for righty batters.

Then Mike Zunino signed, and Francisco Mejía was acquired via trade, and now Hernandez is part of a very volatile mix of strikeout-prone catchers with, especially where Mejía and Hernandez are concerned, big defensive questions. If you just look at raw tools, Hernandez compares to Gary Sánchez and is not only a potential everyday catcher but one who might have real impact. He has big raw power and run-stopping, plus-plus arm strength, but his approach is bad (which might impede the power), and his swing only generates power in certain parts of the zone. He loads his hands very high and deep and then cuts down through the typical hitting zone, which causes Hernandez's power to come toward the top of the zone and out in front when his swing starts to lift, making his point of impact of paramount importance to his power production. My crude video analysis of my in-person looks at Hernandez compared to his 2020 spring training and alt site swings show his footwork has changed. He's starting with an open stance and using more of a leg kick than before. If it improves his timing, this change will be important, and I've slid Hernandez up from the 40+ tier based on it. But his defensive ability, specifically the receiving, might still be a problem and is part of why Kevan Smith was ahead of him on last year's depth chart. He's still a high-variance prospect with some flaws that may be exploited in a significant way at the big league level, but Hernandez has a shot to be an everyday player due to his power.

His mobility and plus-plus arm make him a potential impact defender there, and he may end up playing other positions, too. The Astros gave him some reps in the outfield after he signed in 2019, and Lee had amateur experience at several infield positions. He's currently catching on one knee, with his hands working from the ground up as he tries to frame fastballs at the bottom of the zone. While one-knee'd catching can create problems for some guys as they exit their crouch to throw, it's not a problem for Lee, who explodes out of his stance and maintains sound footwork that helps enable arm accuracy. 
He doesn't have a long track record with the bat, however. Yes, Lee hit .320/.420/.626 as a junior at Cal but he didn't perform anywhere near that level as an underclassman and hasn't really had an opportunity to reinforce that line in pro ball because the pandemic washed away what would have been his first full season. Pro scouts who saw him in 2019 after the draft thought his swing was long, sweeping downward in an unimpactful way, and also thought he struggled to recognize breaking balls. His 2020 instructs and 2021 spring training looks were much stronger than that, though, which seems to have coincided with a change to Lee's swing. He's eliminated a big leg kick and simplified his footwork. His rare physical ability combined with the low industry inventory at the catcher position makes him a potential everyday player if the swing change helps make him an even average all-around offensive player. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3010034"

He's now a lock to remain a starter and will likely play an integral role in Houston's rotation going forward. During the course of a start, he'll typically sit in the 90-94 range and touch as high as 96 while working an awful lot to his glove side with the heater and his two very distinct breaking balls. Both Garcia's slider/cutter and curveball are average, though his slider has a little more lateral movement than it did in 2020, so maybe that pitch is above now. It's his tailing mid-80s changeup that has the nastiest action, and the best chance to finish big league hitters. 
Garcia was a 32% strikeout, 11% walk rate guy in the minors, including his most recent full season in 2019, the only time in his pro career he's exceeded 100 innings. He no longer looks like the sort of pitcher who'll produce peripherals like that over a full season and I'd expect both of those rate stats to fall. The lack of a short- and long-term workload track record and the leap Garcia might be asked to make in a rotation coming off a short 2020 create some extra volatility here, but Garcia's arm action is so loose and his lower half is so robust and strong that it might be less of an issue for him than it would be for others.

That brings us to Sabato, who played shortstop in high school but is absolutely a first base-only player, if he can even play there at all. Despite this, as I shopped these rankings around baseball, folks thought my pre-draft 40+ FV grade was light due to their confidence in his ability to hit and hit with power. Sabato started mashing the second he arrived at Chapel Hill, clubbing 18 homers as a freshman. He was sophomore eligible draftee, and therefore only played 83 career games, and still teams were about as sure of Sabato's hitting ability as they were of any player's in the 2020 draft. He takes full-body rips but still has acute barrel control. Sabato's issues are mobility and defense. He was a hefty guy for a college sophomore and projects as a 1B/DH-only prospect as he continues to age into his 20s. It means Sabato needs to keep raking to clear that sky high offensive bar, but that's exactly what he's done against elite college pitching.

It's more likely he becomes a righty version of José Alvarado, providing viral GIF fodder at times while raising the blood pressure of Astros fans at others. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"16609"

Urbina's power projection is somewhat limited by his stocky frame, which may be an issue if he does eventually move to a corner. He's an explosive rotator though, and this guy's power doesn't just come from size and strength, but rather an upper body that unwinds kind of like Yuli Gurriel's does. Currently an above-average runner, there's a fair chance he ends up in left field due to a lack of top-end speed, though it might depend on how his body develops. But what's driving the profile here is the bat. Urbina's timing, hand-eye coordination, and all-fields feel for contact at a young age are all advanced for his age. His level of talent is commensurate with high school outfielders typically taken late in the first or sandwich round of a draft. Because of the potential corner profile and lack of physical projection, Urbina will need to perform on paper to climb the FV scale, but the eyeball reports from his amateur days through this Fall all indicate he will. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ","rflqhRGiZ0I","sa3008743"

The shoulder is healthy and with his power, elite arm strength, and incredible bat speed from the right side, Leon is the sort of player who would have prompted teams to burst through their bonus pool when they weren't hard-capped. The success rate of Cuban hitters, especially ones who have had a long time away from baseball during their relocation process and pre-eligibility period, is highly variable, but Leon looked pretty comfortable against big league pitching during 2021 Spring Training, and he squared good velocity several times.

At a compact 6-foot or so, he's unlikely to grow into much more thump even though he's still just about 22 years old. Instead, Celestino is a potential everyday player because of his bat-to-ball skills and his center field defense.

His athleticism is evident not only on defense, but in the batter's box, too, where Celestino stays well balanced during a long, slow leg kick. The lack of power projection caps his ceiling, but I like the defense and bat enough to consider Celestino a potential low-end regular, and a low-variance sort of prospect.

At times clumsy on defense, Cavaco may still be growing into his new body. He was also catching early in high school, and had to move all over the infield during his upperclass days because talented young shortstop Marcelo Mayer (a potential top five pick in 2021) went to the same high school and was playing short. It seemed likely that, considering his absence from the summer showcase circuit (again, this kid had a late growth spurt), Cavaco might struggle to adjust to the quality of pro pitching. But his 2019 summer after signing was worse than anticipated. He hit .172 and struck out in more than a third of his plate appearances.

He wasn't as good during his few defensive opportunities this spring and, as he always has, Lee continues to strike out a lot. He is a power-over-hit type of prospect who takes giant hacks, often falling to one knee as he finishes. His big, long, uppercut swing and huge bat speed generate considerable raw power but also lead to lots of strikeouts, and he can really only lift pitches in the bottom of the strike zone. He has the tools of a three true outcomes right fielder, one who potentially plays above-average corner outfield defense. Maybe some of this is due to how intense his swings are, but I get 40-grade run times on Lee from home to first, and I don't see him stealing a ton of bases or playing center field in the big leagues. The quality of his at-bats against elite competition has been mixed, at best. It's likely going to take a swing adjustment to get Lee hitting for relevant power in games.

Antuna has gotten thicker and stronger than before and is now in the bat-first infielder mold, likely to be passable at a combination of second and third rather than be an everyday shortstop. We don't think there's huge physical ceiling here; the cement on the frame here is pretty dry. There are data-driven aspects of Antuna's profile that are hazy because of the lack of performance, but his 2020 fall eyeball report reads like a good role player. This is a switch-hitter who swings with lift and power from the left side of the plate, and has a shorter, contact-driven look with line drive spray toward the gaps from the right side. Antuna will punish you for missing toward the middle of the plate; the rest of the time, he's throwing the bat head at the ball and doing strength-driven damage. He seems able to identify fastball balls and strikes but is apt to swing over breaking balls, and this is where the data performance piece would be more telling and reliable than scattered looks on the backfields.

Ordinarily I'd worry about Corry's curveball playing down a bit because it's paired with a sinker, but it has really great depth and, at times, some arm-side action that gives it extra utility against righty hitters. Folks who have seen young Tigers lefty Tarik Skubal can use that as a fair delivery comp for Corry, who also has a swooping, high-3/4s arm swing that creates tough angle on his stuff, though Corry's isn't as loose and fluid as Skubal's. He's a fairly stiff, short strider, just not the type of on-mound athlete who typically ends up starting.

It arguably made him more draftable in the Rule 5 since he could perhaps spend more of the following year on the IL. The Giants 40-man'd the raw 20-year-old, but he's probably behind several NRI players on any sort of practical org depth chart because his at-bat quality is so green. This is a risky corner bat, but Canario has potential middle-of-the-order talent because of the raw power. He has huge ceiling if the hit/approach component improves, but I wonder if the compressed developmental timeline created by his presence on the 40-man and potential lingering effects from the injury might make that tough. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","tMkRAh9baAM","sa3003316"

These evaluations are especially important drivers for my opinion regarding India, who was coming off a nagging wrist injury that impacted his performance and ultimately ended his 2019 season (a lat issue ended his 2020). I've been a fairly staunch India skeptic, pointing to his draft year campaign as the anomaly among seasons of otherwise pedestrian output. There's renewed scout confidence in India's bat, at least from a contact perspective. He squared up the player pool pitching at Prasco Park pretty well but the exit velo data from the site is middling, at least at the top end of India's exit velocities. He also may not throw well enough to play third base, or have the range to play second, so I think there's increased risk that he ends up spending most of his time in left field, and I don't think he will have the power to profile as an everyday player there. But I think he might accidentally back into some prized defensive versatility by virtue of the Reds trying him all over the field, and end up playing a valuable multi-positional -- but ultimately bat-centric -- role.

He mostly played third base in high school, but there were some pre-draft calls for him to catch, and the Reds gave him post-draft reps at second and continued doing so during the Fall of 2020 since they wanted to give Rece Hinds as many opportunities at third as possible. I've gotten mixed reviews on how his glove looked at second, including some positive thoughts from outside the org. There's also a chance he's eventually a first baseman; for now I have him projected as a below-average second baseman. 
But the bat is the carrying tool here. Callihan was one of the most polished high school hitters in the 2019 class, and performed against his elite peers on the showcase circuit. There was some merited skepticism surrounding his ability to sustain that in pro ball since Callihan was among the older high schoolers in that class, but now that he's performed against more refined pro arms for over a year and is generating the same reports, it's fair to be more confident in the stick.

On hotshots and anything that requires him to bend or vary the pace of his footwork, he struggles. I wrote him up as a right fielder last year, and I still think either that or first base are his ultimate destinations, but he's upped his chances of staying at third in the last year and it's important to note things are moving in that direction. The hit/power strengths and weaknesses looked the same during instructs. Hinds had the best raw power in the 2019 high school class (so ridiculous he hit a broken bat homer during instructs) but struck out a lot in the showcase setting. He has fair barrel control but stuff on the inner half ties him up due to length in his swing, especially when he tries to get the barrel to something down, and that length and middling breaking ball recognition drive the swing and miss issues. The corner fit and strikeout issues ordinarily place a prospect like this in the 40+ FV tier while they're in the lower levels, but I like some of the underlying hitting elements and the way he's worked to stay alive at third enough to slide him into the tier above that. <em>(Alternate site from mid-August on, Fall Instructional League)</em>","SXH2anSONig","sa1169587"

He was also pitching with a much shorter arm action at the alt site than he was in 2019. Accentuating components (he generates huge extension, which helps create flatter angle, and his fastball has backspin) already made Henry's seemingly pedestrian fastball viable, but the new arm action might bolster command and help him avoid the dips in velo he's sometimes dealt with in the past, when his delivery was uglier and more violent. 
Even though his arm action is much shorter, Henry's fastball command is still pretty spotty (which is fine -- it's a vertically-oriented heater) but his feel for locating all of his secondary pitches is much better. His breaking balls include a mid-80s slider and upper-70s curveball that have two distinct shapes. The curveball has more consistent impact depth and sweep than his slider, but he used the slider most often at the alt site. Henry's changeup is command dependent, and while it's not always located competitively it's almost never in the fat part of the zone.

Like Libby, Thompson's fastball traits don't fit perfectly with it, which limits his curveball utility, but it's a great in-zone offering he can use to get ahead of hitters. His velocity actually ticked down throughout 2021 spring training -- he was 90-94 early, then 88-92 late -- but a source told me he was back up to 95 the week before this list published. There's a new-ish cutter/slider here, too, and it's interesting that even though Thompson has elite curveball spin rates, that hasn't translated to the spin on the cutter/slider at all; that pitch's rates were close to 2,000 rpm during the spring. It looks below-average to the eye. He threw few if any changeups this spring. So health and pro development hasn't enabled Thompson to make a rapid, instant leap in stuff quality.

Winn is an elite on-mound athlete and also has plus-plus bat speed, rotating with explosion on par with lots of Top 100 prospects. His straight line speed and arm strength make him a developmental fit at shortstop and if he can tone down some of the noise in his swing without compromising its explosiveness, he could end up hitting for power, too. The potential for power and viable defense at short would give him a pretty low contact bar to clear; he could only develop a 40 bat and still be a slam dunk everyday player. 
He didn't pitch the summer before his draft year and has a pretty violent head whack, so there's relief risk on the pitching side of the ledger here.

It makes sense to develop Winn as both a hitter and pitcher for a while if only to make sure the position you pick is the correct one.

Hoese was the 2019 case. After putting up an .803 OPS in his draft-eligible sophomore year (he went in the 35th round and didn't sign), he put up a 1.276 OPS in his junior year, with 23 homers and a 38:30 BB/K ratio.

He picked up additional reps during Fall Instructional League. 
Hoese's exit velo data was way down in pro ball, something I'm dismissing because of the injury and therefore am excluding from The Board until we get a valid sample (his college avg/max was 88/104, pro was 84/100). He's not tooled up and doesn't have huge raw power, even with a healthy wrist. Instead he's a very athletic swinger with a quick bat, whose swing is geared for airborne contact.

Torres checked a lot of amateur scouting boxes -- the body, athleticism, stuff, and makeup were all lauded -- and he was a model-friendly prospect due to his age, so while issues with fastball command caused some clubs to project him in relief, he was still a clear top two round talent. Perhaps Torres' fastball command is behind because as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much.

(You should notice that group has begun to striate throughout the system rather than be grouped together.) Martinez is a bit tightly wound but has the requisite footwork, hands, actions, and arm strength to play shortstop. I think it's possible the lack of bend/flexibility becomes more evident as he adds muscle, which may push him to center field. What's most exciting about Martinez, though, is how advanced and potent both of his swings are for a teenage switch-hitter. He's a shorter-levered guy, so both cuts are relatively short, which helps aid his bat-to-ball ability. The wrists drive what is currently doubles power (because of his speed, there are some triples too), both in raw pop and approach. He has a pull-oriented approach as a righty hitter, and while Martinez can lift balls down-and-in as a lefty, his swing is mostly geared for all-fields line drive contact from that side. 
This hitting style and Martinez's relatively modest physical projection (he's already a pretty ripped 6-feet) make me think the ultimate home run totals will be low but that he will still slug.

Now two inches taller then when he signed, Hentges is a huge-framed 6-foot-8, comes from a cold-weather location (he's not even the most famous Sam Hentges from Minnesota, as another is a hockey prospect for the Wild), played both ways as an amateur, and lost a year of development to surgery. That he's still raw at age 24 really isn't all that surprising, nor do I find it particularly concerning, though admittedly some of that confidence comes from knowing how hard Hentges was throwing in his big league outings this spring before the shutdown. In those brief outings, Hentges was living in the 96-99 range after sitting 92 (peaking at 96) last year. Cleveland did not baby his innings after he returned from TJ and perhaps 2019 was a bit of a stuff hangover year for him. If he holds this new velo, even if he only does so out of the bullpen, that kind of fastball and Hentges' breaking ball are enough to make him a big time relief piece. He has crude changeup feel and it seemed to be a focus for him during his spring outings. There's still a chance that comes along (remember, this guy has all the late bloomer traits) and Hentges can start, but the (healthy) floor of a lefty reliever who throws as hard as he does is still exciting even if he can't. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"18548"

A minimalistic swing enables him to make high rates of contact, while the strength in Miller’s hands generates doubles power. It’s not an exciting, athletic style of hitting but on an inoffensive, fundamentally sound defensive shortstop, it’s a pretty interesting skillset. Barring a significant swing change, Miller’s offensive output will likely cap his ceiling near the 45 FV range, but for a third round pick who moves quickly, that’s a great outcome. 
Miller is arguably polished enough to play in the big leagues in 2021, and with Cleveland's infield situation very touch and go with Cesar Hernandez leaving and Francisco Lindor primed to be traded, he may need to. If Cleveland ends up with a one-year stopgap, Miller doesn’t have to be put on the 40-man until December of next year, so even though he’s a polished hitter with upper-level experience and could feasibly be called upon to provide above-replacement-level reps in the event that Cleveland’s middle infield is beset by injury, he doesn’t have to occupy a valuable 40-man spot until it is absolutely necessary. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>","vTrfrO-oxJ8","sa3006673"

But based on scouts' looks in the Fall, Vargas' arm action has shortened up (the shift looks similar to Lucas Giolito's) and though I don't consider it likely yet, he's increased his chances of remaining a starter in the eyes of the industry. For the last couple of years, Vargas has been electric at times and maddening at others. I saw him up to 101 on the backfields in 2018 when his outings were between two and four innings in length, then he pitched at mostly 93-97 as a more traditional starter in 2019. During both years, Vargas' command was very spotty. And despite the velocity, he only generated a 7% swinging strike rate with the heater because it has tailing/sinker shape more adept at inducing weak contact than swings and misses. For him to have a real impact heater, I thought Vargas would need to move to the bullpen where he could sit 97-plus the whole time and rely on sheer velocity to miss bats, but now that his arm action has changed that may not be the case. The alteration may have an impact on literally everything about him -- his breaking ball quality, his command, his fastball shape -- and so far it seems to have already improved the demarcation between his two- and four-seamers. We won't truly know until Vargas starts pitching in actual games, but it's instructive that Cleveland added him to their 40-man rather than Luis Oviedo, who had similar issues and was also given a shorter arm action before the club lost him in the Rule 5 draft. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","fu527xI4SS0","sa3007467"

Johnson will come to spring training poised to compete with Bradley Zimmer, Jake Bauers, Josh Naylor and perhaps Nolan Jones for corner outfield starts against right-handed pitching. He is as tooled-up as any of those players, so gifted that at various points during his minor league career, some scouts and front office personnel have projected him (he was drafted by Washington and traded for Jefry Rodriguez) as an everyday player. The loudest of those tools is Johnson's arm strength, followed by his speed and then, to a lesser extent, above-average raw power that manifests as doubles in games because his swing really only enables home run power to his pull side. Johnson has a career .284/.344/.460 line in the minors and has never produced a batting line below league average as a pro. So given the tools and performance, why isn't he higher on this list? I think big league arms will be able to pitch to him in a way that limits his power output below the corner outfield average and that Johnson's relative lack of defensive instincts make him more of a fit in right field than in center. At one point Johnson was so raw as a hitter that some scouts wanted to see him on the mound, leading me to I hope there would be late development in some of these areas, but now that Johnson is 25, I think he's likely to settle in as a platoon bat. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","_vyB942sM98","19643"

It behooves Cantillo to add power to his breaking ball as well.

Though the developmental context of 2020 should lend some skepticism regarding to his retaining it, a three-year trend in his stuff runs from '18 all the way through this year's spring training. In 2019, Muller touched 98 but sat 91-95 during the bulk of his outings, and that fastball was complemented by a loopy, low-spin curveball and a changeup that had very little velocity separation from the heater. Then, while other pitchers lost about a tick and half of velo at the alt sites on average, Muller's was up. He sat 95-96 there, added spin and power to his curveball, saw his changeup movement beging to improve (which has continued through 2021 spring), and added a really hard slider in the 88-90 mph range. He was parked at 96 during 2021 spring training. On paper, Muller's ability to throw-strikes has regressed as he's climbed the minor league ladder and there's no way to know exactly how precisely he can wield this new stuff. While that may prevent him from being a starter, his stuff is so nasty that he projects to be a late-inning reliever if he moves to the 'pen.

In June it will have been seven years since he was drafted third overall as a bat-first catching prospect who it was thought at the time might have to move to third base or right field if, like Bryce Harper, his defensive development was slowing his bat's ascent through the minors. But Jackson got very heavy very quickly and instead fell down the defensive spectrum out of athletic necessity. Over-aggressive elements of his approach were exposed and, from the outside, it appeared his relationship with the org had soured. The Braves acquired him for Max Povse and Rob Whalen about two-and-a-half years after he was drafted and asked him to catch exclusively, which he has done since joining the org. 
During that time some things have changed. For one, Jackson showed up to 2021 camp looking as svelte and lithe as he has since high school. He's now catching on one knee (which he did last year) even with runners on base (which he did not) and has become much better at framing low pitches as a result. At times, his ball-blocking appears to suffer from this new style but he's still popping in the mid-1.90s on throws to second. Once someone we thought might only catch once an electronic strike zones is implemented and DH until then, Jackson now looks like a viable defender. While he remains a power-over-hit guy, he has rare pop for any player, let alone a catcher. His 2019 minor league HardHit% was one of the highest in the minors, with a whopping 51% of his balls in play that year scorched at 95 mph or more. His epicurean approach at the plate, and what it does to his peripherals, makes Jackson a hit-tool risk, and at most other positions that would be very scary, but at catcher that's going to be fine. While he'll likely begin his career as a backup, Jackson's pop should also get him into the lineup as a DH pretty frequently. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>","HIPG1LxMnlQ","17276"

He'll work his low-90s sinker at the knees, then run his four-seamer up the ladder to finish hitters, and Wilson has great command of his two-plane, upper-70s curveball.

The depth of Wilson's repertoire and his command of it make him a high-probability rotation piece but what he can lean on to miss bats is pretty narrow.

In the last year, I've better integrated an understanding of pitches' approach angle into my thinking, which helps explain how Ryan's stuff works. Pitchers with a release point lower than his (some notable names include Camillo Doval, Hector Yan, Victor Gonzalez) typically project as relievers, and it's rare for someone with a release point as low as Ryan's to also create something even approaching a backspinning axis (Ryan's fastball has about 1:00 tilt, whereas 12:00 would be perfect backspin) since most pitchers with lower release heights also have low arm slots. But Ryan's delivery is starter-y. His release height is low because, like a lot of the prospects in this system, his levers are really short. So Ryan's fastball approaches the plate at an upward angle and has some carry to it, which makes hitters swing underneath it a lot. There are some relief-only types (like James Karinchak) ahead of him, but among full-season minor league starters who threw upwards of 500 fastballs in 2019, Ryan's heater had the highest swinging strike rate. 
Part of the reason to wonder if Ryan ends up starting or relieving is because his secondary stuff is less strong. What I called a cutter last year now has more length to it and is clearly a slider. Aside from that, Ryan's mid-70s rainbow curveball and occasional changeup make up a command/control backend starter's four-pitch mix, it's just that he has a dominant fastball to pair with them. He used his fastball 73% of the time in 2019. There's no precedent for that level of usage among big league starters and there's no way of knowing how big league hitters will adjust to seeing that pitch so often until Ryan faces them. I'm going to bucket him in the multi-inning relief category where hitter adjustments are less likely to occur due to the nature of the job, and think Ryan could be a very good version of one. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3007584"

Even if Pie tumbles down the defensive spectrum, it likely means he's grown into substantial raw power, enough to profile at any position. His current tool grade projections indicate what I think things will look like if his frame develops such that it allows him to stay at shortstop (the Goldilocks Zone), but I think it's going to take a long time before Pie's skillset truly comes into focus and we were robbed of a 2020 look because of COVID. <em>(DR Instructs)</em>","pROw9MwMoSw","sa3008754"

He ended up at Georgia, pitched out of the bullpen throughout much of his freshman year and routinely sat 97-99 in that role, often touching 100. As a starter in 2020, Wilcox sat 93-96 with more consistent command (he walked no hitters in his final three starts and walked just two in 23 total innings) than he had as a freshman, and more effective slider shape. The Padres drafted Wilcox in the third round and gave him $3.3 million, which broke the record for a third rounder's bonus, one they set the previous year with Hudson Head. Wilcox went to instructs -- I have one report from the Fall and Wilcox was 93-94, which is fine considering the context -- and was then traded to the Rays as part of the Blake Snell deal. 
When it's right, Wilcox has a biting, two-plane out pitch in the slide piece, which sits in the 85-89 range and often has more length than any pitch that hard has a right to be. Those two pitches and his current command would be enough to project Wilcox in a late-inning bullpen role, but a better change or split (the development of which was slowed by his freshman role) would enable him to be a mid-rotation piece so long as he retains his velo in pro ball, since the shape of the heater makes it velocity-dependent. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>","mUKE04zP5UU","sa3014443"

That window closed quickly due to the pandemic, so teams' opinions of Bitsko were driven by what he did in the Fall of 2019 (he was 92-96 in front of heavy-hitting eyeballs at East Coast Pro) and, in the case of some teams, what they saw in the bullpen just before the shutdown and any pitch data Bitsko generated thereafter. In all instances, Bitsko's arm strength, curveball, and touch-and-feel command were on par with first round high school arms, though that demographic's track record is scary and has been devalued by teams. That, combined with the possibility that some teams weren't be comfortable taking a player they've barely seen, made Bitsko's stock pretty volatile. He seemed like someone's overslot target in the comp round but the Rays took him before he could fall that far and gave him $3 million. After experiencing fits and starts of shoulder soreness and discomfort during his post-draft remote training, Bitsko elected to have labrum surgery.

His righty swing is borderline unusable right now, but remember we're talking about a super young switch bat; he deserves time to hone that righty feel to hit. 
After instructs, Salas went to Venezuela to play winter ball against grown men and really struggled. The length in his swing was exposed and he K'd in about half of his at-bats. He saw time at both middle infield spots and all three outfield positions while in Venezuela. Because Salas is already filled out and seems very motivated to be in the weight room, he's not likely to stay at shortstop and has a better chance of leaning on his good hands and actions at second base. The swing-and-miss piece is scary. Heuristically, Salas and Cubs shortstop Reggie Preciado belong in the same FV bucket, but the mechanical length creates some distance for me. He could be a Top 100 prospect in a year or a giant swing-and-miss red flag might reveal itself on paper.

He hit .407/.538/.729 and had more walks than strikeouts during his career at Wright State but only hit an impressive sum of homers as a junior. It's likely teams' draft models discounted Burdick slightly due to his draft day age, which was well over 22, and the Marlins were able to pick him up for well under slot in the third round. He went out and crushed Low-A, with his triple slash line (.308/.407/.542) largely reinforced by his underlying data (.276/.366/.490) and visual reports. 
Almost all eyeball reports of Burdick begin with a remark about his physicality. His forearms are as thick as support beams and help him generate huge power; the closest contemporary body comp here is Tyler O'Neill. Even though Burdick is a thicker guy, he takes a pretty athletic swing that demands a lot of his balance through contact, but he never appears out of control, even when he's swinging his hardest. He sometimes strides open in a way that impacts his ability to cover the outer third of the plate and his bat path works in such a way that Burdick tends to shoot pitches in the middle of the zone the opposite way, which makes me kind of scared about whether he'll be able to turn on inner-half big league fastballs. Wright State has an excellent program and college baseball in the Midwest is quite good, but we are talking about a small-school and an old-for-the-level performer here, a 24-year-old who hasn't played above A-ball yet.

He was at the 2020 alt site and got about 30 PA in the big leagues, the first of his career, then played pretty consistently for Toros del Este in the Dominican Winter League before a limited 2021 big league spring run due to a groin injury that shut him down in mid-March. He is a flawed but super-talented player with among the most electric bat speed in pro baseball and a huge lefty cut that produces some epic home runs, though probably not enough to make him an everyday player even though he's talented enough to be one. 
I, like much of the industry, am scared of corner-only prospects who clearly lack plate discipline, and Sánchez is one. He's run a 6.5% career walk rate and tends to get himself out by making poor swing decisions. Additionally, Sánchez's swing has not fully actualized for power (a seven degree average launch angle in 2019, a groundball rate around 50%), so he's fighting an uphill battle to get to his huge raw juice in games since he's either swinging at pitches he can't do anything with or failing to lift a lot of the ones he can. Despite this, Sánchez has performed statistically so far: he's a career .291/.337/.452 hitter, though he has begun to show cracks at Double-A and above, where he's slugging under .400 in 135 games. Again, if you watch Sánchez's bat speed, you'll find it ludicrous that he's not hitting for power. He hits balls very hard (50% of his 2019 balls in play were hit 95 mph or above) and he has feel for contact, just not for contact in the air. A pro scout recently said to me, ""The thing about hitting the ball really hard on the ground is that it's still really hard, and difficult to turn into an out.""

His post-draft summer wasn't great, as Misner failed to hit for power in the Midwest League. Fast forward a little over a year and Misner's swing remains the same (if there's been a subtle change then I'm missing it), which means he'll be limited to damaging mistakes made in the middle of the strike zone like he was in college. Because he can play a pretty good center field, there's a world in which Misner has a substantial big league role even with an incomplete offensive profile, it's just probably one closer to the 1.5 WAR area. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em> ",,"sa3011656"

Built like an NFL tight end, Encarnacion starts with a closed stance and opens his front side up toward the third base line as he strides. How far he opens depends upon pitch location, which can leave him lunging at breaking balls that he thinks are center cut and end up swirling away from him. But Encarnacion has the power to hit balls out the opposite way, even if he's fooled, if the pitch catches enough of the plate. He's sometimes a bit of an adventure in the outfield and the Marlins gave him reps at first base during 2021 spring training, which did not go well.

He was wrapped up in the Braves' international indiscretions and had his deal with the club voided by MLB. (The <em>New York Times</em> reported that although Bae had agreed to sign for $300,000, the Braves planned to pay him an additional $600,000 by reallocating money promised to other signees to him.) Because he had skipped the KBO's draft to sign with an MLB team, the KBO barred him from signing with any South Korean pro team for two years. When he hit the market again, Bae signed with Pittsburgh for $1.25 million. He was found guilty of and later suspended for assaulting his former girlfriend in an incident that occurred on New Year's Eve 2017. After the suspension and a treatment/education program, Bae returned to the field, and was skipped over two levels and sent to full-season ball at age 19, where he hit .323/.403/.430. 
His domestic assault conviction impacts how teams (and people, in general) view, value, and interact with him, but purely on talent, some clubs think he belonged on my top 100 list. Bae's arm may prevent him from playing shortstop, but if that's the case he'll still fit at second base and he has the speed to play center field. It's possible his lack of power hurts his on-base skills as he climbs the minors and pitchers attack him without fear of him doing extra-base damage (he has no minor league home runs yet), but Bae's gotten stronger, his exit velos took a leap in 2019, and he has premium rotational ability. He should develop enough thump to keep pitchers honest and become a table-setting regular at second or in center field. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,"sa3006895"

If you've been following both the prospect lists and the site’s analysis of the recent Padres deals, you'll know the Friars have a penchant for taking expensive gambles on pop-up high school prospects. Head, who signed for a record-setting bonus ($3 million, basically slot at 22nd overall) in the third round, was one of their 2019 selections of this ilk. A two-sport athlete whose football exploits (he was in a QB timeshare at a 6A school) cut into his time on the showcase circuit (though he was known in Texas), Head eschewed his commitment to Oklahoma to turn pro. 
Sometimes prospects who’ve never faced the upper echelon of high school pitching require a prolonged adjustment period upon first entering affiliated ball due to the leap in stuff quality from varsity high school ball, even if that prospect comes from a talent-rich area like Texas or Southern California. But that was not an issue for Head against pro pitching in the 2019 AZL. Despite some clear mechanical flaws, he sprayed hard contact all over the field and hit .283/.383/.417 against the best pitching he’d ever seen in his life. Then we had the long 2020 layoff, and my look at Head in fall instructs after he hadn’t faced live pitching for nearly a year was not as good. He wasn't tracking pitches as well, he was late on some pretty average fastballs, he lacked balance at the plate, and his pitch recognition backed up. His swing does have an arm bar, but that was also true in 2019 when he was letting the ball travel deep and hitting it hard the other way. He added a footwork component that wasn't there in 2019, an extra toe-tap before his stride. I can't outright declare this to have been detrimental, it just wasn't there when he was successful. During the Padres' final day of intrasquads, he (ironically) half-swung at an Omar Cruz fastball that was way inside, which hit Head on the hands (sorry if that’s confusing), causing him to leave the game. 
None of this is enough for me to move off of where I had Head evaluated last year, though. Because of the lack of minor league season, the 2020 Instructional League was full of pitching that was typically more advanced than what Head would have seen during a normal instructs, and he was dropped into that environment after not playing all year. And let’s not forget that Head has some unique athletic traits. He’s ambidextrous, and swings and throws a baseball with his left hand though he quarterbacked primarily with his right, occasionally using his left when he rolled out that way. I still think he’s a potential traditional big league leadoff hitter, but while some others young kids really blew up on the backfields last Fall, Head struggled. The context for those struggles is important, though. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3010889"

Ward was not invited to the Red Sox alt site and he was on the instructs roster but didn't throw in games there, so I have no new notes on him from this year and his reports remains the same. I think it's fair to interpret his exclusion from the alt site as evidence that I am, along with my sources from last year's write-up, a little too high on Ward, but I don't think that leap in logic is enough to move him yet.

His slider is average but has effective, vertical movement, and he has fairly advanced arm-side changeup feel. An average athlete with a smaller frame, there's no overt physical projection that allows us to get excited about Ramirez growing into a monster fastball, so instead we think he's a developmental fifth starter."" 
Well, Ramirez started throwing harder. He was sitting 92-94 at Instructional League and was topping out at 96 without having lost any command, or having begun to overthrow his breaking ball, or anything of that nature. Changeup/command guys tend to outpace traditional projections and though the developmental setting could have allowed for a short-term velo bump that won't hold over a long season (I have Aldo sitting 90-94 in 2019), Ramirez is still on track to be a pitcher similar to Seabold by the time his 40-man deadline arrives. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3005371"

This describes Yorke, who the Red Sox made their surprising first round pick in 2020, and who is perhaps the most divisive prospect I've had to write up so far this offseason. 
I had a 35+ FV on Yorke, pre-draft. The bulk of my in-person looks came during 2019 PG National and the Area Code Games. During that time, he looked like a polished bat who couldn't play shortstop due to a lack of arm strength, perhaps a lingering effect of a labrum tear from Yorke's sophomore year of high school that caused him to spend his junior year DH'ing and playing the outfield. His infield footwork, hands, and actions were all fine, but the arm strength was not, and if that continues, then at best he'll be able to play second base, which is where I have him projected. That's still a favorable place on the defensive spectrum and Yorke doesn't even have to develop a ton of power to profile there so long as he truly has a plus bat that produces bushels of doubles. Indeed, several amateur scouting departments think he'll easily be able to do that, and even the clubs that didn't pick him think Yorke was one of the, if not <em>the</em>, most polished high school hitters on the West Coast in 2020. 
Pro scouts' looks in the Fall were not as strong. One noted to me that they did not see Yorke pull a ball in the air at all during Instructional League. He showed up to the Red Sox alt site looking a little heavier and less athletic than he did the summer before, which perhaps puts him on a trajectory to be a shift-aided second baseman, but he's still young enough for variability in this regard and I'm told that what he looked like at the alt site was better than how he looked physically earlier in the spring. I was light on him before the draft, but still think $2.7 million was overzealous even though it facilitated overslot picks later. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3014546"

Rosario is also very tough to get to swing-and-miss in the zone, but some of that is because he's very conservatively poking, slapping, and slashing soft contact all over the infield and not really trying to hit for power. Realistically, he's a low-end regular in center field, or some sort of weird meta-game role player if the plus defense finally materializes. <em>(Padres and Red Sox alternate sites, Fall Instructional League)</em>","tz3B5XbWgMc","sa3004146"

The background here is odd. As a draft-eligible redshirt sophomore, Rooker hit .324/.376/.528 with 11 homers at Mississippi State, and the Twins drafted him in the 38th round. He didn't sign, returned to school, hit .287/.496/.810, with 23 homers and 18 steals, and was drafted 35th overall. Nobody was totally sure what to make of such remarkable improvement, and Rooker lives in the dreaded right/right 1B/DH bucket for most evaluators, but he had among the best raw power and exit velos in his draft class and emphatically torched the best conference in college baseball. 
Rooker has moved quickly since entering pro ball (he needed to, as he's already 26) and played his entire second full season at Triple-A, where he mashed (.280/.398/.535), though his inability to deal with breaking balls was worrisome. After beginning the summer at the alt site, Rooker got a week-long cup of coffee in September and crushed a bunch of the fastballs he saw, but struggled against breaking stuff. He's a pull-heavy fastball hitter to whom I think opposing pitchers will adjust, but while I typically put corner role-playing bats like this in the 40 FV bucket, Rooker's raw power is so exceptional that I think he'll have unusual impact for a player in that role, so he'll likely graduate as a 40+ FV part-timer. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,"19627"

Last year, I wrote that Winder had some interesting rotation piece elements -- a broad, square-shouldered, 6-foot-5 frame, a repeatable delivery, an arm slot that enables the fastball to compete in the zone -- and that the development of his secondaries would determine if he gets there or ends up in a lesser role. Well, like Canterino, his changeup was altered in 2020 and now has a little more armside fade than it did before, and he's also added a couple hundred rpm to his curveball. Again, all of this is much more difficult to evaluate in the context of Instructional League intrasquads, where development is the sole focus, but Winder has gone from a backend starter prospect to someone whose value could explode if he shows this kind of velo deep into outings and under the stress of an actual season-long workload. <em>(Fall Instructional League)</em>",,"sa3007993"

Depending on the day, his fastball velocity was anywhere from 91 to 98 at the 2020 alternate site, and he seemed a distant thought even at the end of the year when the big club was clamoring for pitching.

His fastball will creep into the mid-90s with big time tail, the kind that can run off the hip of left-handed hitters and back over the plate. He also has a sweeping, two-plane breaking ball that's consistently plus and now has more spin, velocity, and lateral action than it did last season. I don't know if the change is mechanical in nature or if it has impacted the characteristics of Sands' fastball, which spins a lot and missed bats despite limited vertical movement in 2019.

Nova's plus-plus arm may enable him to hide some of what project to be lateral range deficiencies, and he could still end up at third base or playing a Moustakas-y second. 
It puts more pressure on him to develop a better approach than his current, over-aggressive version. Remember though that Nova has performed on paper despite his approach, including a nearly average line as a 19-year-old in the Midwest League back in 2019 that featured 25 extra-base hits in just 75 games.

We're talking about a 24-year-old who has never thrown more than 62 innings in a season and has had several bouts with injury, so it's increasingly likely Szapucki ends up pitching in relief. 
But we're also talking about a lefty with a plus curveball who has struck out more than a batter per inning when healthy, so there's still potential impact here. Even at its typical velocities, which are just below the big league average, Szapucki's fastball has garnered above-average rates of swing-and-miss in the minors (a 13% swinging strike rate on his fastball based on the 2019 minor league data I sourced) thanks in part to its flat angle. If he can continue to live in the 92-94 range like he has this spring, then Szapucki will end up with at least two above-average pitches and be a fine relief fit. If his changeup can actually develop, which still feels possible considering how many reps he has missed, then perhaps he can work in a multi-inning role or one of more significant leverage.

Burdi was knocked around in a limited major league jaunt and his velocity slowly declined (though always remained good) during that stretch. Just based on his -- and perhaps unfairly, his brother's -- injury history, I think the industry will always value Burdi a little lower than his talent, which is that of a late-inning reliever. 
It's odd and perhaps a bit of a yellow flag that he was hit so hard in 2020, but I'm still betting on the combination of velocity and two good secondary pitches and project Burdi as a third bullpen banana. His slider is short and cuttery but it's really hard, in the 88-92 mph range, and it has biting two-plane movement when it's located right. His low-90s changeup also has bat-missing tail. All three pitches are capable of missing bats, Burdi just needs to execute more consistently. During his big league action this year, I noticed he'd alter his position on the rubber depending on the handedness of the opposing hitter.

For a long-levered player who has less in-game experience than most who are the age of a college freshman, Bailey's feel for the barrel is pretty good. He's now had success against both same-aged but more experienced players in the DSL and against an Instructional League pitching pool that was unusually advanced due to a lack of minor league season.

Adolfo has been around for so long that even though he's missed a lot of time due to injury, we have a pretty good idea of what he is. Here's the rundown: Adolfo missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, broke his hamate a month into 2016, played through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018, then missed most of 2019 due to arthoscopic surgery on that same elbow, before being limited to the alt site for 2020. Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 pounds) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they'd like him to play the outfield, he's one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man. 
Adolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he's had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he's been a hedonistic free swinger. He's run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017. It would give him a better chance of playing a consistent role if that increase in patience is real and sustains. The power gives Adolfo a chance to have some 2019 Jorge Soler type seasons while his whiffs make him a high variance hitter likely to have several replacement-level campaigns as well.

He returned from surgery to pitch in the 2019 Instructional League and sat 93-95 mph, throwing strikes. 
Romero's changeup had moved ahead of his slider just before he blew out, but his slider is still quite good. Both flashed plus during his three-game 2020 relief debut. His cambio has bat-missing fade while his slider has in- and out-of-zone utility against lefty batters. His velo, mostly 91-93, was down, but 2020's start-and-stop nature might have been at play here, and a fully actualized Romero probably gets back to throwing harder than that. Romero's 2020 season ended when he slipped and broke his right hand using it to try to break his fall. The Nationals put him on the IL and he went to instructs listed as a rehabber. He curiously did not appear in a 2021 spring training game even though he would seem to be high on a rather shallow pitching depth chart, potentially someone who'll take the ball as a spot starter this year. 
His conditioning and injury track record, as well as what the 2020 season did to everyone's innings workload, make it feel more likely that he ends up pitching in relief for the next year or two as he builds back up. There's uncommon upside here, though. Romero has three real weapons coming at hitters from the left side.

There's some obvious positional redundancy in this org. Joey Bart and Patrick Bailey (especially as a hitter) are both more advanced than Genovés, but Genovés' 40-man timeline (he's already Rule 5 eligible at age 21) means he'll need to be rostered before Bailey.

There are lots of catchers who only first make an offensive impact in their mid-20s and most of them are like Genovés: huge-framed guys with power.

He went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts. 
In the few years since, Beer has continued to perform, albeit with his numbers slowly trending down as he reached his draft year at Clemson, then pro ball for a year with Houston before they shipped him to Arizona as part of the Zack Greinke trade. He's now 24 and has a .294/.388/.508 career line in the minors. He reached Double-A in his first pro season. These are all good signs, and Beer will be a solid big league role player relatively soon. I just can't speak to what his shelf life will be and don't think his ceiling is in the Rhys Hoskins/Pete Alonso realm at all. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","Irm8cYuKHdU","sa3006658"

I saw some average changeups, as well. His fastball control is certainly raw, and while Martinez has a strong, projectable frame, his arm action is somewhat odd, with less external rotation going on than you see with most elite velo guys.

There’s potential for average and on-base skills here, but the lack of ISO could limit his future, and we have him behind Ball here because we think Shewmake's ceiling is close to a 45, whereas Ball's power gives him more than that. 
There are still questions about Shewmake’s ultimate defensive home as well. Scouts were mixed as to his ability to stay at shortstop heading into the draft, as he’s just an average runner who looks a bit stretched there at times, with some projecting him sliding over to second. The Braves love Shewmake’s maturity and baseball IQ, and while his upside is limited, he has a chance to move quickly. <em>(Alternate site)</em>","2MvPIsIO4PQ","sa3010332"

Evaluating Escotto last year was pretty simple.

Then German (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the European country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the Atlantic Sun Conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft. High-velocity fastballs are a dime a dozen these days, but German had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. Clubs who had scouts at that final start shot him up their boards, and the Yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. 
The velo spike held throughout German's first summer in pro ball -- he sat 92-95 and touched 97 mph in the Fall Instructional League, and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing -- and then moved yet another tick in 2019 -- 93-96, touch 98 -- even though German was still starting.

The length of his arm action and the gap between where his secondary stuff is now (German's college breaking ball was scrapped, and his changeup is now his best secondary) and where it'd have to be to play several times through the order means German is likely a fastball-heavy reliever. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3007729"

He struck out roughly 40% of the time combined between his underclass seasons at Tennessee and the wood bat summer ball he played amid them, then exploded during non-conference play in 2020, walking as much as he struck out while slashing .357/.478/.750 for four short weeks. 
He draws some Giancarlo Stanton swing comps because of his closed stance/stride and tucked hands, and Daniels' raw power is only a grade shy of Stanton's. Daniels can also really run and has the Michael Vick, sportscar forward tilt and posture as he does. He'll run some plus times straight through the bag and some 70-grade times with the turn on his way to second base.

In a season split between Low- and Hi-A, Stiever struck out 154 hitters and walked just 27 in 145 innings and became one of the org's better starting pitching prospects.

He sat 91-94, which is a little below his peak 2019 breakout when he would touch those 6’s and 7’s. His changeup looked better, though, and it was a stabilizing force during a jittery first start. 
He’ll need to locate his slider more consistently for it to be effective, and the same goes for his heater if it’s going to live around 93 rather than well into the mid-90s. Stiever also incorporated his secondary stuff more often in his second outing. That’s probably the long-term strategy if this is where his fastball velocity is going to live, but both his breaking ball and fastball spin were down about 200 rpm each compared to the 2019 minor league data I have.

It doesn't matter all that much though because, anticipated rule changes or not, he can't catch, nor can he really play first base. Instead, his is a DH-only profile with serious strength, bat speed, and hand-eye coordination that might enable him to play a valuable situational role if he can overcome a propensity to chase. It's not as if the Yermínator lacks any kind of approach. With two strikes, he ditches his huge leg kick and focuses on putting the ball in play with just his hands and wrists, and he often still hits the ball hard like this because he's so strong.

Instead, his offensive development stalled on its own. Most of the physical tools are intact, Cabello's swing just looked out of whack, and he was coming off of a dislocated shoulder that truncated his 2019. His front side was leaking way down the third base line (which happened during his incredible 2018, too), and his swing was described as long to me, which is odd for a hitter this size. 
This is still a rare blend of skills, especially if the catching is ever revisited.

His velocity climbed from the 90-93 range back into the mid-90s during that time period, but he wasn't exactly dominant for Licey. 
He has a drop and drive delivery that creates a really flat approach angle on his fastball, especially at the top of the strike zone, but Gutierrez's heater currently has other attributes (its spin rate and axis are indicative of sink/tailing action) that don't suit this style of pitching, and he's been homer prone throughout his career. There are several potential solutions. He might be able to just bully the extra velocity past hitters in a relief role, or he may eventually lean into the sink/tail aspects of the fastball and work off a two-seamer (Julio Teheran is actually a pretty clean athlete/delivery comp for Gutierrez). Or the new dev regime might tweak something -- perhaps his hand position or stride direction -- to try to shape how the fastball moves, if Gutierrez is receptive to it.

His numbers are likely inflated due to his age relative to the level, but the industry undervalued him during his draft year because of injury, so it's possible we're seeing something closer to the real Stevenson now. He's already been traded twice (from Toronto to Houston, then Houston to Tampa Bay), so clearly teams are interested in him. I think he's a fourth outfield prospect but he's performing like a table-setting leadoff hitter. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",,"sa3006871"
