"Spencer Torkelson",1,"1B","Arizona State","4YR JR","Petaluma","CA","USA","R","R","Torkelson wasn't drafted as a high schooler from Northern California in 2017, but made it very clear in his first year at Arizona State that he'd be someone worth talking about come 2020 by being one of the best freshman bats in the country, then went out and performed well for both USA Baseball and in the Cape Cod League. He put up more monster numbers as a sophomore before playing for Team USA again, setting the stage for him to be among the top players considered for the top of the first round. As a right-handed first baseman who can really hit and who wasn't drafted out of high school, Torkelson draws invariable comparisons to Andrew Vaughn, the Cal standout who was the No. 3 pick in the 2019 Draft. He controls at-bats extremely well and draws a ton of walks. He's able to drive the ball from foul pole to foul pole and he uses the middle of the field when he's at his best. He's able to hit the ball out to all fields, with tremendous loft power to his pull side. He doesn't sell out for that power, but gets to it with ease. Defensively, he's worked hard to improve at first and is very comfortable there. He's taken some groundballs at third and played some left field, where he's adequate. But it will really be his bat that has him in conversations about the first few picks in June."
"Austin Martin",2,"OF","Vanderbilt","4YR JR","DeLand","FL","USA","R","R","Martin has a chance to follow the path set by Dansby Swanson, who played a starring role in a Vanderbilt national championship and went No. 1 overall in the 2015 Draft. A 37th-round pick by the Indians as a Florida high schooler in 2017, he could have gone in the top five rounds if signability weren't a factor. He started games at six different positions as a freshman and opened last year at second base before settling in at third base, leading NCAA Division I in runs (87) and the Southeastern Conference in hitting (.392) and on-base percentage (.486). The best pure hitter in the 2020 Draft, Martin has tremendous feel for the barrel and makes consistent hard contact with a short, quick right-handed stroke. He's not overly physical and may not have more than average raw power, but his hitting ability allows him to tap into every bit of it. He controls the strike zone extremely well and uses the entire field, exhibiting no weaknesses at the plate. Martin possesses solid speed and the instincts to play faster than that on the bases. A twitchy athlete, he has the quick feet, soft hands and enough arm to handle almost any position, though there are some concerns about his throwing. Scouts were hoping to see him at shortstop in 2020, but he instead opened the season at third base before moving to center field (where he could be a solid defender), and there's some thought he could wind up at second base."
"Asa Lacy",3,"P","Texas A&M","4YR JR","Bryan","TX","USA","L","L","Though Lacy exuded projection and top-five-rounds talent as a Texas high schooler in 2017, his $1 million price tag to give up his commitment to Texas A&M caused him to slide to the Indians in the 31st round. He has improved as hoped and will command a much higher bonus in the 2020 Draft, where he could surpass Jeff Granger (fifth overall, 1993) as the highest selection in Aggies history. After ranking third in NCAA Division I in opponent average (.162) and eighth in strikeouts per nine innings (13.2) as a sophomore, he pitched well with the U.S. collegiate national team in the summer. Lacy has boosted his fastball from 87-91 mph in high school to 92-97 these days, using his 6-foot-4 frame to create downhill plane, and hitters just don't seem to get good swings against it. He employs two distinct breaking balls, a downer curveball and a harder slider in the low 80s, with the slider surpassing his curve this spring and becoming a plus pitch. His changeup fades and sinks and grades as a well above-average pitch at its best, and it should become more consistently plus as he uses it more often. Lacy's biggest need is to improve his command and control. There's some effort in his three-quarters delivery and he's still learning to harness his overpowering stuff, so he can't always locate his pitches where he wants. Even without precise placement, he's a left-hander who can get swings and misses with four different offerings."
"Emerson Hancock",4,"P","Georgia","4YR JR","Thomasville","GA","USA","R","R","Hancock rated as Georgia's second-best prep pitching prospect in 2017 (behind Orioles first-rounder D.L. Hall) but priced himself almost entirely out of the Draft because he wanted to attend Georgia. He was college baseball's best pitcher for the first half of the 2019 season, surrendering a total of eight runs in 10 starts before missing two weeks with a lat issue and not dominating as much once he returned. Though he wasn't at his sharpest during the brief 2020 season, he's still on course to become the highest Draft pick in Bulldogs history, surpassing Jeff Pyburn (fifth overall, 1980). Hancock shares a lot in common with Casey Mize, whom Detroit took with the top pick in 2018. They're both Southeastern Conference right-handers with similar builds who pound the strike zone with a deep repertoire and missed some time during their sophomore seasons. His best offering is a fastball that sits at 94-97 mph and peaks at 99 with riding life, and all three of his secondary pitches grade as at least plus at their best. His go-to breaking ball is a mid-80s slider with which he manipulates the break exceptionally well, and Hancock also has a hard curveball that he relied on more in high school. He hasn't had to use his changeup much but he fades and locates it well, earning some plus-plus grades at times. A quality athlete with good body control, he commands his entire arsenal and should be a frontline starter if he stays healthy."
"Nick Gonzales",5,"2B","New Mexico State","4YR JR","Vail","AZ","USA","R","R","Gonzales has hit wherever he's been, but there's often been a bit of an asterisk by his name. He hit around .600 during his senior year of high school, but it wasn't against great competition in the Tucson, Arizona area high school ranks, and scouts wanted to see him in college. He put up good numbers as a freshman and video game numbers as a sophomore, but it was at the hitting haven that is New Mexico State. But when Gonzales went out and won Cape Cod League MVP honors this past summer by hitting .351/.451/.630, he all but put an end to the caveats. The 5-foot-10 middle infielder has as much pure hitting ability as just about any bat in the 2020 class. He does it with a short and compact swing and a ton of bat speed, controlling the bat head extremely well through the strike zone. There's strength in his compact frame, but he might be more of a doubles hitter even though he did homer seven times on the Cape in 154 at-bats with wood. Gonzales has decent speed and is a solid baserunner, and while he played shortstop this spring, evaluators don't think he has the arm or range to play shortstop. That does limit him to second base, but he's at least average there defensively. Gonzales fits the profile well as an offensive-minded second baseman, reminding some of the Brewers' Keston Hiura, who went in the top 10 of the 2017 Draft. There are less questions about Gonzales' defense and he might be more athletic, so it wouldn't be surprising to see him go in the same neck of the woods in the 2020 first round."
"Garrett Mitchell",6,"CF","UCLA","4YR JR","Orange","CA","USA","L","R","Mitchell was a solid high school prospect at Orange Lutheran in California, one who was firmly in the middle of the Draft Top 100 in 2017. As toolsy as they come, concerns about his ability to tap into those tools consistently and his commitment to UCLA led to him not being selected until the 14th round (by the A's). He started to make good on his potential during a strong sophomore season with the Bruins, though he didn't get a chance to show what he could do with Team USA after a leg injury forced him off the Collegiate National Team. He wasn??t fully cleared last fall, but he still impressed scouts with his batting practice sessions, and he had all tools on display this spring. Mitchell has made real strides with his swing, one of the concerns when he was coming out of high school. He hit consistently for the first time in 2019 and he was doing it again during his junior season. He showed plus power in BP and his ability to transfer that to games makes him one of the top picks in the country. Big and strong, Mitchell is an easily plus runner who can steal bases and cover a ton of ground in center field, a premium position he'll be able to play long term with the chance to develop into at least an above-average defender in time. Mitchell has been playing with Type 1 diabetes since being diagnosed in third grade and has shown he can be a premium athlete while dealing with the disease. Armed with perhaps the best collection of tools in this Draft class, the team taking him will be the one that believes he will be able to use those tools consistently in games at the pro level."
"Zac Veen",7,"CF","Spruce Creek HS","HS SR","Port Orange","FL","USA","L","R","There have been high school outfielders in the Class of 2020 who have been ""famous"" for a lot longer than Veen, a Daytona Beach-area standout. While he was the 2018 PG WWBA Underclass World Championship MVP a year ago, it really wasn't until he was arguably the most consistent performer on this past summer's showcase circuit that he jumped up Draft boards. With a hot start to his spring, he kept soaring up lists to be considered the top high school bat in the class. Veen has the kind of left-handed swing that scouts can dream on, all coming from a projectable 6-foot-4 frame that can definitely add strength. He's more hit over power in games with excellent bat speed, especially because he utilizes a spread out stance, but he'll show off big-time power in batting practice when he stands more upright and creates leverage, showing the ability to loft the ball consistently. He's reminded some of Cody Bellinger offensively and has drawn some Kyle Tucker comps as well, though he's not quite as athletic. A solid average runner underway, Veen plays center field now, but is probably better suited for a corner spot. The Florida recruit is athletic enough with enough arm to profile in right, where his power potential could be a fit as well. If he continues to swing the bat like he did over the summer, he could very well figure into first-round conversations. His step forward at the start of the 2020 season, picking up from where he left off over the summer, has him very much in conversations among teams picking in the top 10."
"Reid Detmers",8,"P","Louisville","4YR JR","Nokomis","IL","USA","L","L","One of Illinois' best high school pitching prospects in 2017, Detmers didn't have wow stuff and was strongly committed to Louisville, so he lasted until the Braves took him in the 32nd round. Three years later, he should go in the top 10 picks as the most polished left-hander available. He set Cardinals records for wins (13, first in NCAA Division I) and strikeouts (167, second in D-I) while leading Louisville to the College World Series as a sophomore in 2019, served as the U.S. collegiate national team's best starter during the summer, then ranked second in D-I in whiffs (48) and whiff rate (19.6 per nine innings) during the shortened 2020 season. Detmers is similar to former Cardinals star Brendan McKay, with an almost identical build and slightly less stuff. His fastball usually ranges from 90-94 mph but plays better than its average velocity because hitters don't seem to see it and he commands it so well. His 72-76 mph curveball has good shape and can be a plus pitch at its best, while his sinking changeup is effective as well. Detmers has a strong, durable frame that helps him repeat his delivery with ease, allowing him to pound the strike zone. His ability to locate his pitches permits him to succeed even when his fastball dips into the upper 80s. He has some of the best pitchability and mound presence in the 2020 Draft, traits that should help him become a mid-rotation starter."
"Max Meyer",9,"P","Minnesota","4YR JR","Woodbury","MN","USA","L","R","Meyer starred at Woodbury (Minn.) High but lacked physicality, so he lasted 34 rounds before the Twins took him in the 2017 Draft. He has continued to perform well at Minnesota, tying the school record with 16 saves as a freshman and leading the U.S. collegiate national team with seven that summer. Desperate for starters, the Gophers shifted him to the rotation a month into his sophomore year and he responded with a 2.11 ERA (second in the Big Ten Conference) before tying for the Team USA lead with a 0.69 mark. Meyer owns the best slider in the 2020 Draft, a wipeout 87-91 mph offering with which he can add and subtract depth. His four-seam fastball is a weapon as well, parking at 93-97 mph this spring, hitting 98 in the ninth inning of one start and maxing out at 100. His fading changeup showed flashes of becoming a solid pitch as he used it more often as a junior. There are questions as to whether Meyer can start at the highest level, mainly coming because he's a lean 6-footer. But he's also a quality athlete who repeats a fluid delivery and fills the strike zone, and he was so dominant in the brief 2020 season, so he has plenty of believers. A dogged competitor who also got regular at-bats in the Minnesota lineup, he's expected to go in the first 10 picks, which would push him past Glen Perkins (No. 22 overall in 2004) as the Gophers' highest-drafted pitcher ever."
"Heston Kjerstad",10,"RF","Arkansas","4YR JR","Amarillo","TX","USA","L","R","A 36th-round pick by the Mariners as a Texas high schooler in 2017, Kjerstad teamed with fellow top prospect Casey Martin to lead Arkansas to back-to-back College World Series appearances in their first two years of college. His 14 homers in 2018 broke the school freshman record of 13 set by eventual first-rounder Zack Cox in 2009, and Kjerstad encored with 17 as a sophomore. He offers the best left-handed power in the 2020 college class and only potential No. 1 overall pick Spencer Torkelson has more pop among collegians. Kjerstad's strength and bat speed give him well above-average raw power to all fields. He has a complicated swing that features a big hand circle in his load, so he has to be precise with his timing to make it work -- but he has done so in college and was the top performer in the U.S. collegiate team's lineup last summer. He's an aggressive hitter who always will accumulate strikeouts as a tradeoff for his pop. Though Kjerstad records below-average running times out of the batter's box, he displays average speed once he gets going. He's not a threat on the bases but plays a capable right field. His huge power and solid arm strength fit the profile for the position."
"Mick Abel",11,"P","Jesuit HS","HS SR","Portland","OR","USA","R","R","A high school player from the state of Oregon hasn't been taken in the top two rounds since the Cardinals took Carson Kelly in the second round of the 2012 Draft. Abel, who helped pitch his Jesuit High School to a state title, was named the state's Gatorade Player of the Year and then pitched well at a variety of summer showcase stops, should be the first Oregon prepster to go in the first round since Matt Smith back in 1994. The 6-foot-5 right-hander shows flashes of three plus pitches, starting with a fastball that was regularly in the 93-95 mph range this summer, though he tired a bit near the end of his run. He throws it downhill with good life at the bottom of the zone and then can come back with a four-seamer up in the zone with riding action. His 82-86 mph slider is a very effective pitch, and he also has feel for a curveball with more over the top rotation to it. The two morph into each other at times, but there's enough differentiation to believe he could throw both in the future, along with a future plus changeup that he sells with good arm speed and features sink and dip at the end. The Oregon State recruit generally throws strikes and he gets as high marks for his maturity and makeup as he does his stuff. He's only going to get stronger and throw harder as he physically matures, something he showed a glimpse of in one outing this spring before things got shut down, giving him the chance to be the first prep arm to come off the board in June."
"Jared Kelley",12,"P","Refugio HS","HS SR","Victoria","TX","USA","R","R","Refugio (Texas) High never has produced a drafted player, though that's about to change in a big way in 2020. Kelley entered the year rated as the nation's top high school prospect and is regarded as Texas' best prep pitcher since Jameson Taillon went No. 2 overall in 2010. He repeatedly dominated on the showcase circuit last summer, including an Area Code Games performance that some scouts said was the best in the long history of the event. Few pitchers can create as much velocity with as little effort as Kelley, who can pump 93-96 mph fastballs and reach 98 with some running action. He already owns an advanced changeup with fade and sink, and he's willing to throw it in any count. His third-best pitch at the moment is a hard slurve in the low 80s that lacks consistency but should develop into at least a solid offering. Kelley combines his now stuff with feel for pitching. The Texas recruit pounds the strike zone and has the look of a frontline starter who could reach the big leagues before he turns 21. His strong, physically mature frame and the ease of his delivery should allow him to log plenty of innings."
"Austin Hendrick",13,"CF","West Allegheny HS","HS SR","Pittsburgh","PA","USA","L","L","See Hendrick, the Pittsburgh-area high school standout, on one day, and a scout might walk away thinking they just saw the best hitter in the 2020 Draft class. See him on another, and that scout might walk away worrying about the prep outfielder's swing. He stood out at the start of Major League Baseball's PDP League and was the only hitter to homer more than once, but he struggled down the stretch there and with Team USA in international competition. There is no question about Hendrick's raw power and he's tapped into it at times on big stages over the past two summers. He has incredibly quick hands and bat speed, along with leverage and loft, to generate that pop from the left side of the plate, but he tinkered with his setup this past summer and there was some concern with the uptick in swing and miss to his game. A very good athlete, Hendrick runs well enough to play center field, but he might profile best in right field, and has the arm strength to fit there as well. While there might be some risk in terms of strikeouts with Hendrick, there isn't a high school hitter in the country with more upside. The Mississippi State recruit has the chance to be a middle-of-the-lineup run producer with tons of power and plenty of scouts still believe in him reaching that ceiling."
"Nick Bitsko",14,"P","Central Bucks HS East","HS SR","Doylestown","PA","USA","R","R","The scouting industry had seen a good amount of Bitsko, even though he was thought to be one of the top high school arms in the Class of 2021. But when the big right-hander from Eastern Pennsylvania announced that he'd be graduating early, that made him eligible for this year's Draft and put him right up with the top prep arms in the country. Bitsko is 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, with plenty of projection and now stuff. He stood out particularly at the East Coast Pro Showcase over the summer, but he has shown consistent ability at every stop. Bitsko was up to 96-97 mph at East Coast Pro, with all fastballs in the 92- to 96-mph range. He combines it with a hard breaking ball that shows plus shape, thrown in the 78- to 82-mph range to get a lot of swings and misses. While he doesn't throw it as much, he does have solid feel for a changeup. Bitsko isn't pure power, either, showing the ability to throw all three pitches for strikes with a chance for future plus command. Teams were going to have to play some catch-up with Bitsko this spring because they weren't bearing down on him over the summer as much as they were with the incoming senior class, something that couldn't happen beyond an early bullpen session because of the shutdown. He's committed to the University of Virginia, which could come into play, but he has the chance to be an early first-round pick."
"Ed Howard",15,"SS","Mt. Carmel HS","HS SR","Evergreen Park","IL","USA","R","R","The starting shortstop on the Jackie Robinson West (Chicago) team that went to the finals of the 2014 Little League World Series, Howard has blossomed into the best prospect at his position in the 2020 high school class. He may not have the lofty ceiling of Bobby Witt Jr. or C.J. Abrams, prep shortstops who went in the first six picks of the 2019 Draft, but he's a steady player who could have solid tools across the board. He's set to become the first Illinois high school position player to go in the first round since Jayson Werth in 1997. Using a simple right-handed swing and a calm approach, Howard makes repeated hard contact. He has impressive bat speed and a projectable 6-foot-2 frame that continues to add strength, so he could develop average or better power. He has solid speed and uses it well on the bases. A smooth defender at shortstop, Howard definitely will be able to remain at the position. He can make all the plays with athletic actions, quick hands and a strong arm capable of making throws from a variety of angles. The Oklahoma recruit has a high baseball IQ and a knack for slowing the game down on both sides of the ball."
"Robert Hassell",16,"CF","Independence HS","HS SR","Franklin","TN","USA","L","L","Hassell's offseason started and ended well, as he was the best all-around hitter and pitched well at the inaugural PDP League in June and July and led the U.S. national team in virtually every offensive category and batted .514/.548/.886 at the under-18 World Cup in South Korea in September. He struggled at times in between, particularly when he got too focused on trying to hit for power. There's some split opinion as to the quality of his tools beyond his bat, but he should be one of the first prep position players taken and the first from Tennessee selected in the first round since Mike White in 1986. The best pure hitter in the 2020 prep class, Hassell has a pretty left-handed stroke and the hand-eye coordination to barrel balls with ease. He's at his best when he lashes line drives to all fields but his swing got too uphill when he made a conscious effort to hit homers in the middle of the summer. There's some debate as to how much pop he'll ultimately have, with some scouts envisioning solid raw power and believing he'll tap into most of it, while other evaluators think he's more lean than projectable and more of a 15-homer guy. Similarly, Hassell's biggest boosters believe he could have solid or better tools across the board with a chance to stick in center field and other scouts think his bat and arm are his only above-average attributes and he'll have to play a corner. Clocked up to 93 mph on the mound, he definitely has enough arm to play right field. The Vanderbilt recruit is a legitimate prospect as a pitcher as well but has a much higher ceiling as a hitter."
"Patrick Bailey",17,"C","North Carolina State","4YR JR","Greensboro","NC","USA","S","R","Coming out of a Wesleyan Christian Academy (High Point, N.C.) program that spawned Wil Myers, Bailey turned down the Twins as a 37th-rounder in 2017. He was named Atlantic Coast Conference freshman of the year in 2018 after setting a North Carolina State first-year record with 13 homers. A veteran of the U.S. national 18-and-under and collegiate teams, he's the frontrunner to become the first catcher selected in the Draft. Bailey is a switch-hitter whose strength gives him solid raw power from both sides of the plate. His pop stands out more than his hitting ability, though he makes consistent contact and draws a healthy amount of walks. While he wasn't productive with wood bats last summer with Team USA, scouts believe he'll produce enough offense to profile as a regular. Even if he doesn't hit, Bailey provides enough defense to at least serve as a backup. He's more athletic and moves better than most catchers. He has solid if somewhat inconsistent receiving skills and has the arm strength to keep the running game in check."
"Garrett Crochet",18,"P","Tennessee","4YR JR","Ocean Springs","MS","USA","L","L","Crochet rated as Mississippi's best prep pitching prospect in 2017 but wasn't quite ready for pro ball or particularly signable, so he fell to the Brewers in the 34th round. He bounced between Tennessee's rotation and bullpen in his first two college seasons, earning the Volunteers' first NCAA tournament victory since 2005 last June -- just two weeks after a line drive fractured and dislocated his jaw. He was sensational in fall practice, vaulting him into top-10-pick consideration, but missed three weeks as a precaution with soreness in his shoulder and made just one appearance during the truncated 2020 season. After working with a 91-95 mph fastball and topping out at 97 during the spring, Crochet dealt at 96-100 for most of the fall, and his heater already played better than its velocity because it has high spin rates. His 82-85 mph slider features above-average spin rates as well and his long arms create difficult angle on his breaking ball. He flashes a well above-average changeup at times, throwing it around 90 mph with deceptive arm speed. For a 6-foot-6 pitcher, Crochet does a nice job of keeping his long levers in sync and providing strikes. Scouts like his delivery and arm action, though he still needs to refine his command to make the most of his overpowering stuff. His short track record with his improved arsenal is a concern, but he still could surpass R.A. Dickey (18th overall, 1996) as the highest-drafted Volunteers pitcher ever."
"Tyler Soderstrom",19,"C","Turlock HS","HS SR","Turlock","CA","USA","L","R","Back in 1993, Steve Soderstrom was the No. 6 overall pick in the Draft out of Fresno State and pitched in the big leagues. Three years prior, he was a 15th-round pick out of Turlock High School in California. That's where his son, Tyler, currently plays and while he's not likely to go as high as his dad did out of college, a solid summer at events like the PDP League and Perfect Game All-American Classic have him firmly on the 2020 Draft map. Soderstrom is an athletic, left-handed hitting catcher whose bat is ahead of his defense. At the plate, he's really polished with a solid overall approach and makes the kind of loud contact that makes people sit up and take notice when he's taking batting practice. He's a hitter first, but he will get to his power. He might be a tick above average as a runner, especially for a catcher, and has shown he has the athleticism to play third and even the outfield. That could be important if teams feel he can't catch long-term. He's been the backup catcher on his high school team, mostly because the starter is a really good defender. Soderstrom's hands work and he has a very strong arm, but he is raw in terms of blocking and game management. A team taking him high will be betting that the UCLA recruit's mobility will be an asset and he can develop into an offensive-minded backstop in the big leagues."
"Pete Crow-Armstrong",20,"CF","Harvard-Westlake HS","HS SR","Sherman Oaks","CA","USA","L","L","Hailing from the same high school, Harvard-Westlake, that has produced big leaguers like Jack Flaherty, Max Fried and Lucas Giolito, Crow-Armstrong has been on radars for some time. He really jumped on the national map when he starred as an underclassman on USA Baseball's 18 and Under team that won a gold medal in the Pan-American Championships. A combination of being under the microscope for so long and a more uneven summer has led Crow-Armstrong's star to fade a bit, though a big push at the start of the spring moved him back up Draft boards. Crow-Armstrong stood out early on in his high school career because of his ability to hit and run. Some swing and miss over this summer had some evaluators concerned, but he does have a track record of making a lot of loud contact. While he's clearly hit over power, he's stronger than some people think and there should be pop in the future, with some of that strength and power showing up before things were shut down. A plus runner, he can really play center and might be the best defensive outfielder in the class. A dynamic athlete who goes hard at all times, he reminds some of a Grady Sizemore type in terms of his frame. He's committed to Vanderbilt and was moving back up closer to the top of the first round with a return to who he'd been, along with some added strength, at the beginning of his senior year."
"Carmen Mlodzinski",21,"P","South Carolina","4YR JR","Hilton Head Island","SC","USA","R","R","The Palmetto State's top prep prospect in 2017, Mlodzinski missed time that spring with a torn fingernail and didn't show enough consistency for a team to gamble on drafting him and trying to sign him away from South Carolina. After serving the Gamecocks as a swingman as a freshman, he opened 2019 as their No. 1 starter but broke his left foot in his third outing and missed the rest of the season. He bounced back in a big way during the summer, ranking as the best pitching prospect in the Cape Cod League and looking every bit like a first-round pick. Mlodzinski sat at 92-96 mph with his fastball on the Cape and touched 99 during fall practice, and his heater also features some sink and run. He flashed a plus curveball in high school but has scrapped that for a low-80s slider with power and depth that sometimes morphs into a cutter. He also shows feel for a sinking changeup and could have three plus pitches once he's fully developed. After compiling a 5.59 ERA while battling the strike zone in his first two college seasons, Mlodzinski pounded the zone and posted a 40/4 K/BB ratio on the Cape. The redshirt sophomore has smoothed out his three-quarters delivery since high school and did a much better job of repeating his mechanics during the summer. He's athletic and his arm works well, so there's no reason he shouldn't have good control."
"Cade Cavalli",22,"P","Oklahoma","4YR JR","Tulsa","OK","USA","R","R","Cavalli didn't take the mound until he was a sophomore at Bixby High and missed most of his senior season with back issues, yet still emerged as Oklahoma's top prep pitching prospect in 2017. His arm could have fit in the top three rounds if not for health and signability questions, and he turned down the Braves as a 29th-rounder to attend Oklahoma. After spending most of his freshman season at first base, he focused on pitching as a sophomore and established himself as a likely first-rounder for the 2020 Draft -- though he also missed three weeks with a stress reaction in his arm. Cavalli produces some of the easiest velocity in his Draft class, working at 92-96 mph and topping out at 98 with riding action while expending barely more effort than he would playing catch. He also can make hitters look bad with a low-80s curveball with power and depth, and he has developed an upper-80s slider/cutter that is catching up to his curve. He shows the potential for an average changeup once he starts using the pitch more often. While Cavalli has the upside of a frontline starter, he comes with concerns. Though he has a strong 6-foot-4 frame and clean mechanics, he doesn't have much track record of staying healthy or throwing strikes. His lack of command and deception also means that his premium stuff gets hit harder than it should."
"Cole Wilcox",23,"P","Georgia","4YR SO","Chattanooga","TN","USA","R","R","Not only does Georgia have a candidate for the No. 1 overall pick in Emerson Hancock, but it also has a second potential first-round arm in Wilcox, something the Bulldogs haven't been able to claim since Derek Lilliquist and Cris Carpenter went in the top 14 picks in 1987. Wilcox also drew first-round interest in 2018 and finished ahead of fellow Georgia prep products Ethan Hankins (the Indians' first-rounder that June) and Kumar Rocker (the projected No. 1 overall choice in 2021) in MLB Pipeline's final rankings. A Draft-eligible sophomore, he opened his first college season in Georgia's bullpen and moved into the weekend rotation for the final month. Wilcox has some of the best pure stuff in the Draft. His fastball usually ranges from 92-97 mph and can reach 100 with some sink and armside run. Both of his mid-80s secondary pitches show signs of becoming plus offerings, with his fading changeup a tick more reliable than his power slider. Though Wilcox is athletic and has a strong, durable frame, he comes with starter-versus-reliever questions. Scouts don't love his delivery, which features a low elbow and a long arm stroke that allows hitters to track the ball well out of his hand. His fastball has a history of getting hit harder than it should and he sometimes struggles to provide quality strikes."
"Dillon Dingler",24,"C","Ohio State","4YR JR","Massillon","OH","USA","R","R","Dingler teamed with Ball State right-hander Kyle Nicolas, another early-round prospect for the 2020 Draft, to win Ohio state Division I baseball and basketball titles when both were Jackson High seniors in 2016-17. He spent most of his freshman season in center field and broke the hamate bone in his left hand during the season opener as a sophomore, costing him a month and limiting him after he returned. He performed well this spring, giving him a chance to become the third first-round pick in Ohio State history, following Nick Swisher (2002) and Alex Wimmers (2010). Dingler reminds area scouts of former Wright State catcher Sean Murphy, a 2016 Athletics third-rounder who has blossomed into one of baseball's top catching prospects. He doesn't quite have Murphy's plus-plus cannon but he does possess well above-average arm strength and his accuracy continues to get better as he gains experience. His receiving also continues to improve and he shows more athleticism and mobility than most backstops. While Dingler batted just .267/.362/.396 in his first two college seasons, he controls the strike zone well and has plus raw power, so he should be able to hold his own as a right-handed hitter. He ran a sub-6.6-second 60-yard dash during the Buckeyes' scout day this fall, though he probably won't maintain plus speed as he stays behind the plate. In addition to his physical tools, he also offers strong makeup and was voted an Ohio State captain as a sophomore."
"Bryce Jarvis",25,"P","Duke","4YR JR","Lexington","KY","USA","L","R","A year ago, Jarvis was a strike-thrower with a good changeup and big league pedigree (son of former pitcher Kevin), who could have gone toward the end of the top 10 rounds if he were signable as a sophomore-eligible. He wasn't and turned down the Yankees as a 37th-rounder, then opened eyes with a much stronger body and stuff in the fall. Scouts wanted to see if he could maintain them over a full college season and never got the chance to find out, but he did throw one perfect game and flirt with another in his four starts -- which may be enough for him to join Marcus Stroman as the only first-round picks ever out of Duke. After working with an 88-93 mph fastball at the beginning of 2019 and dipping to 86-91 by season's end, Jarvis added 20 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame and operated at 92-96 with effective downhill plane last fall and this spring. His breaking ball used to be average at best, and now he flashes a plus curveball in the upper 70s that he can manipulate into a distinct and equally effective slider in the mid-80s. His fading changeup remains his best secondary offering, grading as well above average at its best. Jarvis has improved his control along with his stuff, posting a 40-2 K-BB ratio in 27 innings while showing the ability to move his pitches around the strike zone. He repeats his delivery well and long has drawn praise for his competitiveness. Though he's already 22, has a narrow frame and lacks a long track record of displaying first-round stuff, he couldn't have been much more spectacular this spring."
"Bobby Miller",26,"P","Louisville","4YR JR","Elk Grove Village","IL","USA","L","R","Louisville has recruited well in Illinois for years and landed both Miller and Reid Detmers from the Prairie State in 2017. A 38th-round pick that June by the Orioles, Miller moved into the Cardinals' weekend rotation last March as a sophomore and has boosted his stock since. He took a no-hitter into the ninth inning of an NCAA super-regional playoff against East Carolina and wowed scouts with his velocity and slider during fall practice. Miller's fastball is notable for both its heat -- he sat at 95-96 mph throughout his dominance of East Carolina and worked at 97-99 in shorter stints in the fall -- and its heavy life. He also can miss bats with a slider/cutter that usually operates at 85-87 and reached 90 during the fall. He has faith in a splitter/changeup with similar velocity and employs a more traditional change in the low 80s. With his strong 6-foot-5 frame, Miller has no difficulty maintaining his stuff into the late innings. However, there's effort in his delivery that limits his control and has some scouts wondering if he's destined to be a reliever in the long run. After maintaining his improved stuff and doing a better job of throwing strikes during the brief 2020 season, he could join Detmers in the first round."
"Austin Wells",27,"C","Arizona","4YR SO","Las Vegas","NV","USA","L","R","Wells was a solid prospect at Las Vegas high school power Bishop Gorman, but a combination of him only DHing all year along with his commitment to the University of Arizona took him out of contention to sign. The Yankees did take him in the 35th round in 2018 and he's now back as a Draft-eligible sophomore coming off a solid freshman season and very strong Cape Cod League showing. There is no question that Wells' bat plays. The left-handed hitter has power to all fields, with good timing and a simple setup at the plate. He has strength and bat speed and controls the bat head well to make loud contact. He does strike out a bit, but he also draws a lot of walks. There are more concerns about where he might play defensively. He's adequate behind the plate, and while his arm stroke and release are fine, his throws are inconsistent. He is a decent enough athlete to play first or figure things out in left field. A team taking Wells with its first pick might want to send him out as a catcher until he proves he can't play the position. His bat should play regardless of his eventual defensive position and he could end up following a Kyle Schwarber type path to the big leagues."
"Tanner Burns",28,"P","Auburn","4YR JR","Decatur","AL","USA","R","R","Burns displayed first-round stuff when he was Gatorade's Alabama state player of the year in 2017, but questions about his size and signability caused him to slide all the way to the Yankees in the 37th round. He immediately cracked Auburn's weekend rotation as a freshman and struck out 15 in a game as a sophomore to tie the program record shared by Tim Hudson, Casey Mize and three others. Shoulder tightness caused him to miss a start last May and limited him during the Tigers' run to their first College World Series appearance in 22 years. When he's 100 percent, Burns can work at 92-97 mph with his fastball and locate it to both sides of the plate. His breaking ball can be a plus pitch at times, combining slider velocity in the low 80s with curveball depth, but it gets slurvy at others. He hasn't had much need for his changeup, though it has some sink and shows some signs of becoming an average third pitch. Burns lacks size and while he's strong and athletic, he comes with durability concerns because of his shoulder issues as a sophomore and a history of seeing his stuff dip later in the season. Though there's no projection remaining in his 6-foot frame, his proponents see some similarities to another former Southeastern Conference star, Sonny Gray. Scouts wanted to see if he could stay healthy and maintain his stuff throughout his junior year, but the 2020 season lasted just four weeks."
"Chris McMahon",29,"P","Miami","4YR JR","West Chester","PA","USA","R","R","McMahon was a solid high school product outside of Philadelphia who was No. 100 on MLB Pipeline's Draft Top 200 as the 2017 Draft rolled around. The former three-sport standout (soccer and basketball) slid in the Draft, going in the 33rd round, and opted to go to Miami instead. A knee injury cut short his freshman year, and his sophomore year was up-and-down as the Hurricanes' Saturday starter. But he was one of the best performers for USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team, something that carried over to the start of his junior season. The right-hander has more than enough stuff to succeed as a starter at the next level. His fastball is up to 95-96 mph consistently, with late action on it down in the zone, and he was up to 98 mph this fall. He knows how to spin a breaking ball, but it gets caught in between being a curve and slider, looking more like the former. He has a very good feel for his changeup that can miss bats and get ground-ball outs. When he's on, McMahon combines athleticism, stuff, feel for pitching and command to make him a complete package. With an arm action that can be a little deep, he can get flat and gets hit more than he should. He got out front more consistently and didn??t leave pitches up for Team USA and early this spring, solidifying his spot as one of the more solid college arms in the class."
"Casey Martin",30,"SS","Arkansas","4YR JR","Lonoke","AR","USA","R","R","Scouts rated Martin as the best high school prospect in Arkansas in 2017, though his bat was considered too raw for pro ball and he went undrafted. He made an immediate impact with the Razorbacks, hitting 13 homers as a freshman to help them reach the College World Series, then slammed 15 as a sophomore to bring them back to Omaha. He's one of the best athletes in the 2020 college crop and is Arkansas' toolsiest prospect since Andrew Benintendi went seventh overall in the 2015 Draft, but a poor start to the shortened 2020 season could drop him out of the first round. An explosive athlete, Martin offers an exciting combination of power and speed. He records run times that grade from 70-80 on the 20-80 scouting scale, though he's still learning how to translate that quickness into stolen bases. He has the potential to be a 25-25 player but gets overly homer-conscious and his right-handed swing gets too uphill, leading to strikeouts. If Martin can slow the game down a bit offensively and defensively, he can be a star. His quickness and solid arm strength give him the tools to play a number of positions and perhaps stay at shortstop if he becomes more consistent. He played a fine third base as a freshman and definitely would fit in center field, though he should be able to stay on the dirt."
"Slade Cecconi",31,"P","Miami","4YR SO","Oviedo","FL","USA","R","R","In high school, Cecconi intrigued scouts with his size and live arm that lit up radar guns early in the summer showcase circuit before his senior year. But the combination of an injury that kept him off the mound for most of that senior year and a strong commitment to the University of Miami forced him to slide to the 38th round in 2018. After spending his freshman year in the Hurricanes' rotation, Cecconi is one of the more intriguing Draft-eligible sophomores in the country. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has the kind of strong and durable frame scouts love to see in a pitcher, and he shows the stuff to match at times. His fastball is regularly up to 96 mph, though his velocity drops off as he goes deeper into starts. Cecconi can be up in the zone too much and gets hit, especially when his velo declines. He throws two breaking balls, with his slider the better of the two, especially when he throws it hard, up to 87 mph. Then it's like a hard cutter with late action and power to it, but he has some arm action issues with it when it's slower and he can get around it at times. He has a changeup, but it's not a real factor, and his curve is in some ways his fourth pitch. He throws strikes, but his command within the zone needs to be refined. Cecconi is a college arm with upside because of his arm strength, though there are debates on whether he??s a starter or reliever long-term. He??s convinced many he can maintain his stuff to start, but there is the chance he ends up in a bullpen one day, where that fastball-slider combination would play up."
"Justin Foscue",32,"2B","Mississippi State","4YR JR","Huntsville","AL","USA","R","R","Foscue went from light-hitting third baseman as a freshman to consensus All-America second baseman as a sophomore, helping Mississippi State reach the College World Series in both 2018 and 2019. He and Jordan Westburg form the best double-play combination in college baseball, with scouts fairly split about who is the better prospect. Foscue has a higher floor while Westburg has the high ceiling, and both project to go in the top two rounds of the 2020 Draft. The U.S. collegiate national team's starter at second base last summer, Foscue plays a game that is somewhat reminiscent of Jeff Kent's. He provides more offense than most at his position, using strength, bat speed and a pull-heavy approach to generate plenty of power from the right side of the plate. Though he has an aggressive mentality, he has no difficulties making regular contact and projects as a 20-homer threat without excessive strikeouts. Foscue records below-average run times out of the batter's box but shows closer to average speed once he gets going. His arm and range are ordinary at second base, though he has good hands and instincts and turns the double-play pivot well. He might be able to handle third base at the next level but shortstop would be a stretch, limiting his potential utility value."
"Jordan Walker",33,"3B","Decatur HS","HS SR","Stone Mountain","GA","USA","R","R","Arguably the best Duke baseball recruit ever, Walker is a quality student whose parents attended MIT and Harvard. The odds of him becoming a Blue Devil decreased, however, when he established himself as the top corner-infield prospect in the 2020 high school class. Georgia has produced a prep position player in the first round of 10 of the last 12 Drafts and he could join that club in June. Walker generates easy bat speed from the right side of the plate and has tremendous leverage and projectable strength in his 6-foot-5 frame, giving him some of the best power potential in this Draft. There are some mixed opinions on his hitting ability because his size creates a naturally long swing and he needs to improve his ability to recognize breaking balls. But he also shows some feel for hitting and the ability to make adjustments, so he should make enough contact to tap into his pop. Athletic for his size, Walker can produce some solid run times but figures to lose a step once he matures physically. He should be able to remain at third base for a while, though if he loses some quickness he'll likely wind up on an outfield corner. He has solid arm strength and has been clocked in the low 90s on the mound, so he should profile well in right field if he has to move."
"Carson Montgomery",34,"P","Windermere HS","HS SR","Windermere","FL","USA","R","R","One of the top high school right-handers in this Draft class, Montgomery committed to attend Florida State for college over two years ago. With electric stuff and a solid summer showcase circuit that included pitching in the PDP League and striking out the side in his inning of work at the Under Armour All-America Game, Montgomery very well may never make it to Tallahassee. With a quick arm and an athletic frame, Montgomery's stuff is led by a live fastball that regularly gets up to 94-95 mph. He complements his heater with a power breaking ball that's a bit of a slider/curveball hybrid, thrown typically in the 78-80 mph range, but can get up into the low 80s at times. He doesn't need his changeup much in high school, but he does show very good feel for it, with some scouts thinking it could eventually develop into his best secondary offering. Montgomery throws a lot of strikes, repeats his delivery fairly consistently and has a good gameplan on the mound with more polish than many hard-throwing prepsters. The Seminoles and new head coach Mike Martin Jr. would undoubtedly love to have him lead their staff for the next three years, but he could be one of the first high school arms to get drafted."
"Drew Romo",35,"C","The Woodlands HS","HS SR","Fountain Valley","CA","USA","S","R","The track record of high school catchers in the first round is dreadful, with Joe Mauer (No. 1 overall, 2001) the only one in the last 37 Drafts to accrue even 5.0 WAR in the Majors while staying behind the plate. Nevertheless, Romo has a chance to go in the first round in June because he's an outstanding defender who made strides offensively on the showcase circuit last summer. He's part of a powerhouse program at The Woodlands (Texas) High that has produced five big leaguers, including Paul Goldschmidt and first-round picks Kyle Drabek and Jameson Taillon. Romo's prowess behind the plate allowed him to lock down the starting job on the U.S. 18-and-under national team for the last two years. A potential Gold Glover, he possesses soft hands, advanced receiving skills and a strong arm with a quick release. He also garners praise for his leadership ability, work ethic and baseball IQ. Scouts have fewer questions about Romo's bat after he performed well against quality pitching during the summer, though he didn't get off to a great start in 2020 before his senior season ended prematurely. A switch-hitter, he has a better swing from the left side but has improved from the right. The Louisiana State commit will provide more contact and on-base ability than power, but he can become a .260 hitter with 12-15 homers per year while running the bases better than most catchers."
"Nick Loftin",36,"SS","Baylor","4YR JR","Corpus Christi","TX","USA","R","R","Undrafted as a Texas high schooler in 2017, Loftin could be the first college shortstop selected three years later. He began his college career at Baylor as a left fielder before moving to short midway through his freshman season. He doesn't have loud tools but he contributes in all phases of the game and has one of the higher floors in the 2020 college crop, a combination that could land him in the first round. Loftin is more of a competent than flashy defender at shortstop, where his instincts help him play quicker than his pure speed. He has solid arm strength and should be able to stay at short at the next level. He offers impressive versatility -- he started games at five positions (short, second and third base, left and right field) for the U.S. collegiate national team last summer -- and would fit nicely as a utilityman if he doesn't provide enough offensive impact to be a regular. Using an efficient right-handed swing, Loftin focuses on making contact and ranked 12th in NCAA Division I with 13.8 at-bats per strikeout as a sophomore. While he does have some sneaky power, he's mostly content with hitting line drives to all fields. He has average speed out of the batter's box and isn't much of a threat to steal, though he is faster once he gets going."
"Jordan Westburg",37,"SS","Mississippi State","4YR JR","New Braunfels","TX","USA","R","R","Though neither was a heralded prospect or drafted out of high school in 2017, Mississippi State's Westburg and Justin Foscue have developed into college baseball's best double-play combination. Foscue has been a more consistent hitter but Westburg has a higher ceiling and more defensive value. He tied a College World Series record with seven RBI in one game in 2018 and helped the Bulldogs return to Omaha last season. Westburg has a compact right-handed swing and possesses the bat speed and strength to provide 20 or more homers on an annual basis. He lacks consistency at the plate because he has a very aggressive, pull-happy approach and sometimes struggles with pitch recognition and managing the strike zone. After he failed to make the U.S. collegiate national team last summer, he settled down nicely in the Cape Cod League and was one of the circuit's more productive hitters. Westburg has solid speed and arm strength to match, giving him a chance to stick at shortstop at the next level. He's big for the position at 6-foot-3 and if he adds more strength to his frame, he could slow down and necessitate a move to third base. With his power potential, he still could profile offensively at the hot corner."
"Daniel Cabrera",38,"CF","LSU","4YR JR","Baton Rouge","LA","USA","L","L","Scouts considered Cabrera one of the best high school hitting prospects and a potential second-rounder in the 2017 Draft, but his steadfast commitment to Louisiana State dropped him to the Padres in the 26th round. He has a similar reputation as one of the top college bats for 2020, though he has been more of a steady than spectacular performer for the Tigers. He could be the first LSU position player taken in the first round since Alex Bregman went No. 2 overall in 2015. Cabrera is equipped to hit for average and power. He has a smooth left-handed swing and doesn't try to do too much at the plate, letting his bat speed and the loft in his stroke create natural pop. He commanded the strike zone well as a freshman and less so as a sophomore, when he was hampered by a right wrist injury. Though he ran a 6.6-second 60-yard dash at a Cape Cod League workout last summer, Cabrera is more of an average runner and not much of a threat to steal. A left fielder in his first two college seasons, he shifted to right field as a junior. He has the solid arm strength to handle right field at the next level."
"CJ Van Eyk",39,"P","Florida State","4YR JR","Tampa","FL","USA","R","R","A high school pitcher in Florida who was on the rise in 2017, Van Eyk missed a chunk of his senior year with arm soreness that all but cemented he'd be heading to Florida State instead of signing. After spending his freshman year pitching out of the bullpen, he made a smooth transition to the Seminoles' rotation as a sophomore and is now near the top of a solid crop of college pitchers in the Sunshine State eligible for the 2020 Draft. Van Eyk has a solid three-pitch mix that he knows how to use extremely well. He's been up to 95 mph, usually working in the 93-94 mph range, with his fastball and commands it well to both sides of the plate. He really knows how to spin his curveball, a breaking ball with almost 12-to-6 action that has really good late downward bite. He throws it in the upper-70s more often than not, but can add and subtract as needed. His changeup is his third pitch, and would be more effective if it had more sink, but he does throw it with good arm speed to fool hitters. The Florida State ace is capable of being a complete pitcher because of his willingness to pitch in with his fastball, his ability to throw his breaking ball at any point in the count and his feel for mixing his pitches to keep hitters off-balance, though issues with his command persisted over his first four starts in 2020. His potential as a starter still should have him in consideration in the top two rounds of the Draft."
"Alika Williams",40,"SS","Arizona State","4YR JR","San Diego","CA","USA","R","R","Williams attended baseball powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School in the San Diego area, but scouts felt he needed to add strength to raise his offensive profile and that college would allow him to develop. While he was taken by the Yankees in the 32nd round in 2017, he did head on to Arizona State. After an ordinary freshman year, he took a nice step forward as a sophomore, then followed that up with a strong summer on the Cape and for Team USA. Even in high school, Williams showed the ability to control the strike zone and make consistent contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't swing and miss much, and walked more than he struck out during his sophomore year. While power will never be a huge part of his game, he has added some strength and showed extra-base ability last year with the Sun Devils and with wood in his hands for USA Baseball. He's not a burner, but he runs better than average and he has a good first step defensively. With above-average hands, range and ability to throw on the run and from different angles, he should have no problem staying at shortstop long term. Williams reminds some in the area of Kevin Newman, the University of Arizona shortstop who went in the first round of the 2015 Draft and is now the Pirates starter at the position. Williams has the chance to also be an everyday player at the premium position at the big league level."
"Aaron Sabato",41,"1B","North Carolina","4YR SO","Rye","NY","USA","R","R","Sabato received little recruiting hype or scouting interest as a Connecticut high school senior in 2018, and he began his college career at North Carolina by hitting .186 with one homer in his first 14 games. He caught fire afterward, batting .380 with 17 dingers in his final 44 contests to set a Tar Heels freshman home run record and claim Atlantic Coast Conference freshman of the year honors. Though surgery on his right shoulder prevented him from showing what he could do with wood bats during the summer, he's still one of the best sophomore-eligible prospects in the 2020 Draft and his power could land him in the first round. A right-handed hitter, Sabato possesses exceptional strength that combines with his bat speed and the loft in his swing to give him well-above-average raw power. While he has a power-over-hit approach, he's patient enough to accept walks when pitchers won't challenge him and doesn't strike out excessively. There are some parallels between him and the college version of Pete Alonso, though Alonso slammed just four homers as a freshman. Almost all of Sabato's value will come from his bat, so he'll have to hit. He worked hard to improve his defense and has reliable hands at first base, but he lacks range and had below-average arm strength before he hurt his shoulder. He's a well-below-average runner with limited athleticism."
"Blaze Jordan",42,"1B","DeSoto Central HS","HS SR","Southaven","MS","USA","R","R","DeSoto Central High (Southaven, Miss.) produced a supplemental first-round slugger in Austin Riley in 2015, and five years later has a player with even more raw power. Jordan ranked as one of the top players in the 2021 class until he reclassified last May, becoming one of the youngest (17 years, five months on the originally scheduled Draft day of June 10) and most intriguing prospects in the 2020 group. He won the High School Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game in July, though he had less success facing live pitching on the showcase circuit. Few players in the 2020 Draft can do more damage to a baseball than Jordan, whose legend began to grow when he won his first national home run derby at age 11 and belted a pair of 500-foot homers at another when he was 13. His combination of impressive strength and bat speed allows him to hit mammoth blasts without a lot of loft in his right-handed stroke, and he recorded the highest exit velocity (106.9 mph) at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He still has to answer questions about his hitting ability after a summer of swings and misses against older competition, though his proponents think he'll make enough contact once he gets more time to adjust. While Jordan has worked diligently to lose weight and improve defensively at third base, most scouts believe he's almost certainly destined to play first base as a pro. The Mississippi State recruit possesses average arm strength but he's a below-average runner whose lack of quickness is better suited for first base. Wherever he plays, he'll create most of his value with his power."
"Dax Fulton",43,"P","Mustang HS","HS SR","Weatherford","OK","USA","L","L","Last summer, Fulton battled Nate Savino (Virginia's Potomac Falls High) for the distinction of being the top-rated prep left-hander in the 2020 class. Neither will pitch in high school this spring, however, because Savino will bypass his senior season and the Draft to enroll early at Virginia and Fulton underwent Tommy John surgery in September. The latter still could be the first prep southpaw selected in June and could sneak into the supplemental first round. Before he got hurt at the U.S. 18-and-under national team trials in August, Fulton worked with a 90-93 mph fastball that played better than its velocity because he creates steep downhill plane with his 6-foot-6 frame and high three-quarters arm slot. He's already strong and has the room to add more muscle, so he could work in the mid-90s once he regains his health. His curveball is a legitimate plus pitch with power and depth, and he shows some feel to manipulate its break. Fulton's changeup should be an average or better offering once he spends more time developing it. For such a tall teenager, he does a nice job of keeping his long limbs in sync and throwing strikes with his entire repertoire. After verbally committing to Vanderbilt, he officially signed with Oklahoma."
"J.T. Ginn",44,"P","Mississippi State","4YR SO","Flowood","MS","USA","R","R","The Dodgers selected Ginn 30th overall out of a Mississippi high school in 2018 but didn't have the money to meet his asking price after paying second-rounder Michael Grove an over-slot bonus. He earned Southeastern Conference freshman of the year honors in his college debut, capping his season with six scoreless innings in a College World Series start against Louisville. Projected as a likely 2020 first-rounder as a Draft-eligible sophomore, he made just one three-inning appearance this spring before requiring Tommy John surgery. When healthy, Ginn usually deals at 91-95 mph and tops out at 97 with some of the best fastball life in the 2020 Draft, as his heater will run and sink and bore at various times. His wipeout slider can be just as difficult to hit, combining mid-80s velocity with two-plane depth. He also gets good downward action on his changeup, which shows flashes of becoming a plus offering. Despite the movement on his pitches, Ginn controls and commands them well, giving up just 19 walks and one homer in 86 1/3 innings as a freshman. He has toned down his delivery since high school, lessening concerns that he'll wind up in the bullpen in the long run. He's athletic but already came with durability concerns after a sore arm limited him at times during the second half of the 2019 season."
"Cole Henry",45,"P","LSU","4YR SO","Florence","AL","USA","R","R","Henry opened eyes when he touched 97 mph and flashed a plus curveball in the first outing of his Alabama high school senior season in 2018, but he fell to the Tigers in the 38th round because he asked for first-round money to give up a scholarship from Louisiana State. He missed fall practice with a stress reaction in his upper arm, then emerged as LSU's best starter as a freshman before missing a month with a sore elbow. He's one of the best Draft-eligible sophomores in the 2020 Draft -- provided he can stay healthy. Henry has the potential for three solid to plus pitches. His fastball usually runs from 90-94 mph and tops out at 96 with riding or sinking action, and he could add some more velocity once he gets stronger. His mid-70s downer curveball gives him a second plus pitch when it's on, while his mid-80s changeup has some depth and continues to get better. When he was in high school, Henry's delivery featured a lot of effort and some head whack. He has improved his mechanics in college and had no trouble providing strikes as a freshman. He has the look of a durable mid-rotation starter but must prove he can stay on the mound."
"Logan Allen",46,"P","Florida International","4YR JR","Altamonte Springs","FL","USA","R","L","Allen was a solid pitching prospect coming out of the Florida high school ranks, one who was taken in the 16th round by the Orioles in 2017 because of his chance to have a three-pitch mix and his feel to use his entire repertoire. He headed to Florida International as a two-way player and continued to hit and pitch for two-plus years, but his future as a pro is certainly on the mound. In many respects, Allen is the same pitchabilty lefty that he was in high school, just with more track record after two years at FIU and a strong performance on the Cape last summer. He goes right after hitters with three pitches. He sits right around 90 mph with his fastball, but can reach back for up to 93 mph when he needs to, and he commands it well, with good arm-side finish. His changeup is his bread and butter, a potentially future plus circle change he sells really well with good fade and sink that misses bats and elicits weak contact on the ground. His curveball is his third pitch, a breaking ball that can get a little big at times. He commands the ball very well and knows how to set up hitters. Because of his lack of physicality and lack of wow stuff, Allen's ceiling is somewhat limited. But he's shown the ability to keep hitters off-balance and could be the kind of advanced college lefty who moves through a system quickly, always a commodity when the Draft rolls around."
"Cade Horton",47,"SS","Norman HS","HS SR","Oklahoma City","OK","USA","R","R","Oklahoma featured one of the best two-way prep prospects in last year's Draft in Jenks right-hander/shortstop Bryce Osmond, and the state has an even better version for 2020 in Horton. Now at Oklahoma State, Osmond was a second-round talent whose asking price knocked him down to the Nationals in the 35th round. Signability also could be a factor with Horton, who accounted for 4,233 yards and 41 touchdowns as a senior quarterback and has committed to play two sports at Oklahoma. Scouts prefer Horton on the mound, where his quick arm produces 91-94 mph fastballs that peak at 96. He has an advanced changeup for a high schooler and also owns a solid slider, with both secondary offerings operating around 78-82 mph. He already throws strikes and features little effort in his athletic, three-quarters delivery, and he could have three plus offerings if he focuses solely on pitching. Though he'll probably get drafted as a pitcher, Horton is a legitimate prospect at shortstop. He's a quality defender with the quickness, hands and arm to remain at the position. His right-handed power potential presently stands out more than his pure hitting ability, and he possesses average speed."
"Kevin Parada",48,"C","Loyola HS","HS SR","Pasadena","CA","USA","R","R","While Parada has been a known quantity for a while -- he was the MVP of the Perfect Game WWBA World Championships in 2018 -- he really jumped on the prospect map with a very strong summer showcase performance in 2019, standing out in Major League Baseball's PDP League and playing in PG's All-American Classic. Parada has the chance to be a solid all-around backstop when all is said and done. He has the potential to hit for both average and power. He shows more pull power now, but should have the ability to drive the ball to all fields. He's a hitter first right now who is content to go the other way and who doesn't strike out a lot, but there's plenty of strength for him to tap into. He's pretty athletic and runs well for a catcher. Behind the plate, he has an above-average arm that's accurate, but his other defensive skills are just adequate. There's some stiffness, but he should be good enough to stay behind the dish long term. He has shown the ability to play other positions should catching not work out and his athleticism should allow him to handle another spot if a team wanted to let his bat play. Any team wanting to draft and sign him away from his commitment to Georgia Tech would likely send him out as a catcher and let him develop as an offensive-minded backstop."
"Burl Carraway",49,"P","Dallas Baptist","4YR JR","College Station","TX","USA","L","L","Carraway first piqued Dallas Baptist's interest as a center fielder and threw in the mid-80 as a Texas high school senior in 2017, so he wasn't a high-priority recruit and didn't attract interest from pro clubs. His velocity began to climb as a freshman but he was so raw that he made just two appearances and retired only one of the seven batters he faced. He made a huge leap forward as a sophomore, averaging 15.6 strikeouts per nine innings as the Patriots' closer and becoming the first player in school history to make the U.S. collegiate national team. The favorite to be the first reliever drafted in 2020, Carraway has a pair of overpowering pitches in his fastball and curveball. His heater sits at 93-96 mph and touches 98 with riding action, while his downer curve usually parks in the upper 70s. His pitches play up because they have high spin rates and he gets good extension in his delivery, and both can grade as well above average when at their best. As a 6-footer who lacks physicality and features a lot of effort in his high three-quarters delivery, Carraway is strictly a reliever. His control and command have improved in college but still need to get better if he's going to hold down a high-leverage role in the big leagues. He should be one of the first players from the 2020 Draft to reach the Majors."
"Seth Lonsway",50,"P","Ohio State","4YR JR","St. Mary's","OH","USA","L","L","Ohio's best high school prospect in 2017, Lonsway had top-five-rounds talent but fell to the Reds in the 19th round because of his commitment to Ohio State. Academically ineligible because of a transcript snafu in 2018, he led the Big Ten Conference with 126 strikeouts in 92 1/3 innings as a redshirt freshman last year. He topped NCAA Division I in strikeout rate (21.0 per nine innings) in the truncated 2020 season and was pitching himself into the first round until he walked eight in two innings against Stetson in his final start. Lonsway has one of the best curveballs in the 2020 Draft, a bender with power and depth that earns comparisons to Barry Zito's hook when at its best. He showed more velocity than ever this spring, working at 93-94 mph at times and topping out at 96 with riding action on his four-seam fastball. He has added a solid slider/cutter to give him a harder breaking ball and shows some feel for a changeup, though he doesn't use it very often. There are serious concerns about control and command with Lonsway, who locates his curve better than his fastball and walked 18 in as many innings as a redshirt sophomore. He has an odd delivery with a nearly over-the-top slot and an extreme head tilt, and he has trouble keeping everything in sync. He can be unhittable when he throws strikes with his fastball but struggles to do so more than he should, which might land him in the bullpen if he can't figure it out."
"Clayton Beeter",51,"P","Texas Tech","4YR JR","Fort Worth","TX","USA","R","R","Beeter has had as many elbow operations as quality starts (two) in college, yet he pitched so well this spring that some scouts think he belongs in the first round. He blew out his elbow during fall practice before what would have been his first season at Texas Tech, having Tommy John surgery in December 2017 and an arthroscopic procedure seven months later. He led the Red Raiders' 2019 College World Series semifinalists with eight saves as a redshirt freshman, then really opened eyes with nearly twice as many strikeouts (33) as baserunners (18) in 21 innings in 2020. Beeter added rather than lost velocity as he worked longer stints this year, sitting at 93-96 mph and peaking at 98 with his fastball. He has a pair of power breaking balls, a wipeout curveball in the low 80s and a slider in the mid-80s that some evaluators believe is even better. He even flashes at least a solid changeup, though he doesn't turn to his fourth option very often. Employing an overhand delivery that creates deception and steep downhill plane, Beeter tunnels his pitches extremely well. Scouts can't figure out how he went from averaging 8.7 walks per nine innings as a reliever to 1.7 as a starter without any significant mechanical changes. His lack of track record is worrisome but it's hard to argue with the quality stuff and strikes he unleashed this spring."
"Carson Tucker",52,"SS","Mountain Pointe HS","HS SR","Phoenix","AZ","USA","R","R","Back in 2014, Cole Tucker was a bit of a surprise first-round pick out of Mountain Pointe High School in Arizona and he became one of four Mountain Pointe products to make it to the big leagues when he debuted with the Pirates in 2019. His younger brother, Carson, hopes to join them, and though he??s a different player and personality than his older brother, he was enjoying a similar rise up Draft boards thanks to a very strong early spring. While more reserved than Cole, Carson has the chance to join his brother as a big league caliber shortstop. At the plate, the right-handed hitter displays excellent bat control and bat speed over power, though he showed added strength this season. He??s often content to push the ball the other way and to the right-center field gap, though the ball does jump off his bat. He began showing he can turn on balls and drive them to his pull side more consistently, helping his profile. Tucker has the feet and hands to play shortstop long-term, even though he??s an average runner. He has average arm strength, though his throws have good carry and he shows the ability to change arm action and slots as is needed for the premium position. Showing more consistency on the defensive side, along with the aforementioned gains at the bat, are why Tucker??s stock took a leap forward this spring, making a stronger case for a team to sign him away from his commitment to the University of Texas."
"Tanner Witt",53,"3B","Episcopal HS","HS SR","Houston","TX","USA","R","R","Kevin Witt was the 28th overall pick in the 1994 Draft and hit 15 homers in five years in the big leagues. His son Tanner shows intriguing power potential as a third baseman but even more promise on the mound. One of the more projectable arms in the 2020 Draft, he could fit in the top three rounds if he's signable away from a Texas commitment -- which may not be possible. At 6-foot-6 and 198 pounds, Witt has plenty of room to add strength and velocity, and he excited scouts by sitting at 92-93 mph and touching 95 in the final start of his truncated senior season. He usually works at 88-92 mph with his fastball, which features solid spin rates and some riding action. He also gets good spin rates on a mid-70s downer curveball that could become a plus offering once he adds more power, and he shows the aptitude to manipulate it into a harder, tighter slider. Witt also demonstrates some feel for a changeup that he throws with fastball arm speed but arrives a bit firm in the mid-80s. He uses a high three-quarters arm slot to produce difficult angle and does a nice job of keeping his long levers in sync in his delivery. He's only scratching the surface of his potential as a pitcher and may need time to develop, but the payoff could be significant."
"Masyn Winn",54,"SS","Kingwood HS","HS SR","Katy","TX","USA","R","R","Winn earns comparisons to Matt Bush, the No. 1 overall pick in 2004, for a variety of reasons. He's a legitimate two-way prospect as a short but talented shortstop with a live arm that can deliver upper-90s fastballs on the mound, and he also comes with makeup concerns because he got sent home early from the inaugural PDP League in July. He was the talk of the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October, when he touched 98 mph with his fastball, backed it up with two plus secondary pitches and homered in the same game. Winn has a higher ceiling on the mound, where he has a pair of high-spin-rate weapons in a heater that sits at 92-96 mph with riding action and a curveball that ranges from 79-82 mph. His low-80s changeup isn't as consistent as his fastball and curve but can give him a third plus offering at its best. His size and the effort in his delivery lead to questions as to whether he can hold up as a starter, but his athleticism and lightning-fast arm help his cause. Some scouts prefer Winn as a shortstop and he profiles as a regular there. The Arkansas recruit still needs to refine his hitting ability from the right side of the plate but he possesses plus raw power and solid speed with good instincts on the bases. His arm is an obvious asset and he has the quickness to make plays."
"Jared Jones",55,"P","La Mirada HS","HS SR","Whittier","CA","USA","L","R","Jones has been on radars for quite some time now as a two-way standout, starring for his La Mirada High School team at the 2019 National High School Invitational and countless showcase events like the PDP League this past summer. While his father, Keith, spent two summers as an infielder in the D-backs system, Jared's future is definitely on the mound. Jones will show three usable pitches, though he's more arm strength than pitchability at this point in his young career. But there's plenty of arm to like, with a fastball that is up to 96-97 mph on a consistent basis, thrown with good tail. He'll flash a solid slider that he adds and subtracts from, but it's at its best when it's the harder 80-82 mph version of the pitch and not the more slurvy 74-78 mph offering. He does miss bats with it, though a lower elbow in his delivery leads to him getting underneath it at times. He doesn't need his changeup much now, and it's a bit firm, but the 85-88 mph offspeed pitch has the chance to give him a third at least average offering. Jones?? command has been inconsistent at best, not unusual for a prep power pitcher. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, he's strong and athletic, getting good genes from both his father and his mother, who played collegiate softball. Initially committed to attend Southern California, Jones switched to Texas when USC coach Dan Hubbs was fired."
"Alex Santos",56,"P","Mount Saint Michael Academy","HS SR","New York","NY","USA","R","R","There isn't a strong history of pitchers getting drafted and signing out of the New York City high school ranks. Leury Tejada was a 10th-rounder in 2018 who signed with the Rangers. Santos is a fellow Bronx native who has the chance to do much better than that after a strong summer showcase circuit performance that included a spot on USA Baseball's 40-man 18U National Team Trials roster. Santos is tall and projectable with long limbs who has the chance to have a three-pitch mix, though he's a bit raw. Over the summer, he consistently showed a fastball in the 90-94 range with good life, sitting in the 92-93 mph range in most of his outings. Given his size and a frame that should allow him to add strength, it's easy to dream about velocity gains. He'll throw a 76-78 mph slider to complement the fastball and he has good feel for a changeup that touches the low-80s. While he's more projection than now stuff, Santos did show an ability to pitch without his best stuff during the Area Code Games, pitching more off his changeup effectively. Teams might have to be patient, but the Maryland recruit is the kind of high-ceiling prep arms that many organizations covet."
"Justin Lange",57,"P","Llano HS","HS SR","Fredericksburg","TX","USA","R","R","Lange turned in a lackluster performance at the Area Code Games last August, topping out in the low 90s, but intrigued scouts a bit when he hit 95 mph at the Future Star Series in September. That was merely an appetizer, as he repeatedly reached the upper 90s this spring and touched 100. He also has one of the best bodies in the high school pitching class and could draw first-round interest, though most clubs are more comfortable with him in the second round because of his lack of track record. Lange usually pitched around 94-95 mph this spring, featuring some run and sink at lower velocities and less life at the higher end of his velocity range. He also features power with a slider that's very inconsistent and ranges from a well below-average sweeper to a plus pitch in the mid-80s with much more bite. His changeup is even more of a work in progress because he has little reason to throw it against lower-level Texas prep competition. Full of fast-twitch athleticism, Lange has added 25 pounds of muscle since last summer and also shows promise as an outfielder who flashes plus raw power and speed. The Dallas Baptist recruit has a huge ceiling but a long way to get there, because his control and command are as raw as his secondary pitches and his low arm slot with a high elbow raises red flags. His proponents think he'll be able to add polish once he gets into pro ball and benefits from better coaching."
"Jeff Criswell",58,"P","Michigan","4YR JR","Portage","MI","USA","R","R","Criswell ranked as Michigan's top prep prospect in 2017, but questions about his consistency and signability dropped him to the Tigers in the 35th round. He dominated as a reliever for the Wolverines as a freshman, then served as one of the best No. 3 starters in college baseball in 2019. He became a bullpen weapon again at the College World Series, getting crucial outs behind second-round picks Karl Kaufmann and Tommy Henry as Michigan came within a victory of the national title. Criswell took over as the Wolverines' Friday starter in 2020 and has the stuff to go in the same range as Kauffmann and Henry did. He maintained his velocity while transitioning from reliever to starter, showing the ability to work at 93-96 mph with heavy sink for several innings at a time. Both his slider and his fading changeup are solid secondary pitches that arrive in the low 80s. While Criswell unquestionably has the repertoire and strong build to start at the pro level, he's still learning to harness his stuff. He lapses into overthrowing at times, which causes his delivery to get out of sync and his control to waver. If he can do a better job of locating his pitches, he could develop into a mid-rotation starter."
"Jake Eder",59,"P","Vanderbilt","4YR JR","Boynton Beach","FL","USA","L","L","MLB Pipeline rated Eder as the fifth-best high school left-hander in the 2017 Draft, but his strong commitment to Vanderbilt knocked the second-round talent all the way down to the Mets in the 34th. A midweek starter as a freshman and a reliever as a sophomore, he closed out the Commodores' 2019 College World Series championship with a three-inning save against Michigan. He did a much better job of harnessing his stuff in the Cape Cod League in the summer and during fall practice, but his velocity and control regressed during the shortened 2020 season. When Eder is at his best, he can work at 92-95 mph and touch 97 with his fastball and back it up with a plus curveball. But there also are days when he'll sit closer to 90 mph and lack feel for his curve. Though he can flash a solid changeup, it's still a work in progress because he hasn't used it much in short stints with the Commodores. Eder threw all three offerings for strikes on the Cape but sometimes has trouble finding the zone and can get hit hard when his location is off. His strong 6-foot-4 frame is built for durability and helps create tough angle on his pitches. If he can maintain the consistency and command of his stuff that he showed in the summer and fall, he could be a mid-rotation starter."
"Kyle Nicolas",60,"P","Ball State","4YR JR","Massillon","OH","USA","R","R","As a Jackson (Ohio) High senior in 2016-17, Nicolas teamed with current Ohio State catcher Dillon Dingler to win state Division I baseball and basketball titles. Both project to go in the first two or three rounds of the 2020 Draft, and Nicolas helped his cause by striking out 17 in seven one-hit innings against Sacred Heart in his final start. The nephew of former NFL quarterback Todd Blackledge, he throws even harder than former Ball State teammate Drey Jameson, who went 34th overall to the Diamondbacks last June, but he's not nearly as polished. Nicolas has one of the best fastballs in college baseball, sitting in the mid-90s as a starter and reaching 100 mph in shorter stints this fall. He also can overpower hitters with a slider that resides in the mid-80s, approaches 90 and features sharp break when it's on. Both his heater and slider have high spin rates as well and are legitimate swing-and-miss offerings. Nicolas' curveball has its moments, though his use of two breaking balls sometimes causes them to blend together, while his changeup lags behind the rest of his repertoire. There's nothing glaring with his delivery and he doesn't throw with excessive effort, but he has trouble keeping his mechanics in sync. He showed little feel for throwing strikes before this spring, so his premium stuff comes with considerable risk that he'll be a reliever."
"Cam Brown",61,"P","Flower Mound HS","HS SR","Lewisville","TX","USA","R","R","Easily the best high school prospect in the northern half of Texas, Brown excelled on the showcase circuit throughout the summer. He turned in one of the best outings at the inaugural PDP League, breezed through a perfect inning at the Under Armour All-America Game and kicked his stuff up a notch at the Area Code Games. Flower Mound High produced a pair of second-rounders in the 2005 Draft in Craig Italiano and Paul Kelly, and the Jaguars could have another in Brown, though his brief senior season was fairly pedestrian. Brown usually works in the low 90s and tops out at 96 mph with his fastball, which features heavy sink and some running action. His sharp, two-plane 78-82 mph slider gives him a second solid offering and played as a plus pitch at the end of the summer. He also can flash a changeup of similar quality, getting swings and misses even if it's a bit firm in the mid-80s. The top recruit in Texas Christian's 2020 class, Brown has a classic pitcher's build. He has an easy delivery that he repeats well, which bodes well for his ability to throw strikes and stay healthy. If his stuff continues to improve, he could wind up in the middle of a big league rotation with a pair of plus pitches and a solid changeup."
"Isaiah Greene",62,"OF","Corona Senior HS","HS SR","Riverside","CA","USA","L","L","After a lackluster junior season at Corona High School in Southern California, Greene wasn't on many radars as a potential top-three-rounds player. He jumped onto the map with a very strong Area Code Games and then really stood out as part of a scout team that played against USA Baseball's 18-and-under team before it headed to international competition this fall. Greene has as impressive raw tools as anyone in Southern California. There's no doubt he can stay in center field, where his plus speed will allow him to stay in the long-term, though he has much to learn in terms of reads and routes. That speed also allows him to be aggressive on the basepaths. He can really hit with a contact-oriented approach. His swing is pretty flat, but he still can drive the ball at times, with scouts thinking power will come as he figures that part of his game out. He's relying on hand-eye coordination and feel for the barrel more than his swing mechanics and approach at the plate. Even without much polish, Greene really stood out against top competition over the summer and fall. Though he didn??t hit as well out of the gate this spring, he may be the most improved player in the area over the last year and there's still plenty of room for growth, giving teams reason to consider the Missouri recruit in the early rounds."
"Kyle Harrison",63,"P","De La Salle HS","HS SR","San Jose","CA","USA","R","L","De La Salle High School in Northern California is a bit of a baseball dynasty, having won four straight division titles heading into the 2020 season. Harrison has been a key part of two, including winning the championship game as a junior before embarking on a successful summer showcase circuit that culminated with a very strong turn on USA Baseball's 18U National Team. Harrison has the chance to be a very solid left-handed starter with a three-pitch mix and a feel to use all three offerings well. He's been up to 93 mph with his fastball, usually sitting closer to 90-91 mph, throwing his heater with good life. It's tough to square up coming from a difficult angle thanks to a three-quarter slot. His slider is his out pitch, an upper-70s breaking ball that's especially tough on left-handed hitters. He also has good feel for his changeup and commands all of his pitches well. There are some who might see Harrison, a UCLA recruit, as having a limited ceiling. His pitchability and the deception of his delivery from the left side does give him a higher floor than most high school pitchers and makes him one of the top prep lefties in the class."
"Drew Bowser",64,"SS","Harvard-Westlake HS","HS SR","Los Angeles","CA","USA","R","R","Scouts in Southern California were hoping get two for the price of one as the 2020 Draft approached when they went to see Harvard-Westlake play, though stoppage of play early in the spring limited the twofer opportunities. While outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong is likely to get a lot of first-round consideration, his teammate on the infield, Bowser, isn't far behind talent-wise after a strong summer that included MVP honors at the Perfect Game All-American Classic. A shortstop in high school, the 6-foot-3 Bowser likely will need to move over to third at the next level. Reminding some of Hunter Greene as an infielder, Bowser has good hands and a plus arm, but he lacks the foot speed and range to stay at shortstop long-term. The good news is that he could be an above-average defender at the hot corner should he make that move permanently. It also looks like he has the offensive profile for the position. In the past, his bat would look slow at times and he would cast it out, dragging it through the zone. But he's worked hard to tighten up his swing and make it more compact. He used to struggle with velocity on the inner third of the plate, but now has no issues turning on those pitches and he uses his leverage well to produce solid power. A student of the game, Bowser loves to talk hitting and has the chance to develop into a run-producing corner infielder at the next level. The one thing that might make it tough is his commitment to Stanford, which his mother attended."
"Corey Collins",65,"C","North Gwinnett HS","HS SR","Coatesville","PA","USA","L","R","Part of the North Gwinnett High (Suwanee, Ga.) program that also produced Charlie Blackmon, Collins has one the highest offensive ceilings among this year's high school catchers. He didn't get much of a chance to show what he can do on the high school showcase circuit last summer because he injured his throwing elbow at the Prospect Development Pipeline League in June. Following nerve transposition surgery, he returned behind the plate this spring but spent most of his time at first base before the high school season ended. The strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame give Collins plus raw power from the left side of the plate. While he doesn't have to swing for the fences to hit home runs, he does get overly aggressive and pull-happy at times, so he'll have to adjust his approach against better pitching. He moves surprisingly well for a big-bodied catcher, flashing fringy speed from home to first base. Though North Gwinnett was easing Collins back into catching duty, his solid arm strength has bounced back since his surgery. He has the strong hands and agility to become at least an average receiver, and he has enough athleticism to handle left field if a club wants to maximize his offensive production. The top prospect in Georgia's recruiting class, he may be difficult to sign."
"Nolan McLean",66,"3B","Garner Sr HS","HS SR","Willow Spring","NC","USA","R","R","One of the top two-way prospects in the 2020 Draft, McLean also was a four-year starter at quarterback for Garner (N.C.) High and will try to play two sports at Oklahoma State is he doesn't turn pro this summer. Scouts preferred him as a pitcher until this spring, when he cleaned up his swing and his body and barely took the mound before his senior season ended abruptly. He did more hitting than pitching for the U.S. national team that won a silver medal at the under-18 World Cup in South Korea in September. McLean's strong 6-foot-3 frame produces impressive raw power, though he had a hitch in his right-handed swing that concerned scouts until he smoothed it out this spring. He also has improved his footwork at shortstop, and while his below-average speed means he'll move to third base in pro ball, it's now easier to project him as a solid or better defender at the hot corner. On the mound, McLean has a pair of solid offerings with high spin rates: a fastball that sits at 91-95 mph and reaches 97 with sink and run, and a mid-70s curveball. He also shows some aptitude for a low-80s changeup and throws strikes from a low three-quarters slot. He could pull double duty if he heads to college and will be eligible for the 2022 Draft as a sophomore if he does."
"Daniel Susac",67,"C","Jesuit HS","HS SR","Roseville","CA","USA","S","R","esuit High School in Sacramento has a well-deserved reputation for producing top-notch baseball talent. That includes the Phillies' Rhys Hoskins, who was a fifth-round pick after college, and Andrew Susac, who went in the 16th round out of high school before emerging as a second-round pick following his time at Oregon State. Now it's his brother's turn, with Daniel playing the same position as his sibling. Big and physical, Susac wasn't seen much on the summer showcase circuit because he's also Jesuit's quarterback. The arm he shows off on the gridiron helps him behind the plate as well. He shows plus arm strength, though it plays down a bit right now because of a slower release. A switch-hitter who many feel is better from the right, Susac has some feel to hit and considerable raw power. He's willing to use the whole field, but he can get long with his swing and out of sync at times. Susac was initially slated to follow in his brother's footsteps and go to Oregon State if the Draft didn't work out, but switched to Arizona because of coaching changes at OSU. Even with a lack of summer looks and a shortened spring, his considerable raw tools could make where he's committed to college a moot point."

The prize of Kentucky's 2020 recruiting class, he may not make it to Lexington because he's one of the more polished and projectable high school pitchers in this year's Draft. But the truncated high school season cost him a chance to take a step forward, clouding his status. Hagenow already shows the makings of three solid or better pitches, starting with an 88-93 mph fastball that runs and sinks and should add more velocity as he fills out his 6-foot-5 frame. His slider should get quicker as well, and it's already effective at 78-83 mph. He also has advanced feel for using a changeup with similar velocity as well as some fade and sink. Though Hagenow has some crossfire in his delivery, it adds deception without compromising his ability to throw strikes. He uses his size to leverage his pitches down in the zone and his frame should lend itself to durability. He has all the ingredients to become a mid-rotation starter once he's fully developed"
"Tommy Mace",69,"P","Florida","4YR JR","Tampa","FL","USA","R","R","In 2017, Mace was a very good high school pitching prospect in the Tampa area. The Reds took him in the 12th round in the hopes of making a run at signing him, but his commitment to Florida, along with the Reds running out of bonus pool money, sent him to Gainesville to be a Gator. After a freshman year spent mostly in the bullpen, he was a weekend starter for all of his sophomore season, showing enough glimpses to leave scouts excited to see what he might do as a junior as Florida's Friday night starter, though he was only able to make four starts before the season was stopped. Mace has a four-pitch mix that continues to improve. He's been up to 96 mph with his two-seam fastball, usually sitting more in the low-90s and thrown downhill from his 6-foot-6 frame. His best secondary pitch is his cutter, thrown in the upper-80s that has the chance to be a true out pitch in the future. His curveball is a slower, upper-70s slurvy kind of pitch that provides a nice change of pace from the hard cutter, and his changeup is still developing, though it's better than it was in high school. Mace generally does a nice job of throwing strikes, keeping the ball down in the zone and getting groundball outs. He gets high marks for his mound presence and makeup, putting him among a solid crop of top two round college pitchers in Florida."
"Nick Garcia",70,"P","Chapman University","4YR JR","Redwood City","CA","USA","L","R","A position player at Junipero Serra (Calif.) HS, Garcia headed to Division III Chapman as an infielder. He appeared in just 24 games as a freshman then moved to the mound as a sophomore. He found immediate success in the bullpen, winning nine games and saving 12 more to help the Panthers win a national title, earning College World Series Most Outstanding Player honors in the process. After pitching well out of the pen on the Cape last summer, Garcia moved into the rotation at the start of his junior year and created a lot of early buzz in the process. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has shown glimpses of three pitches that have the chance to be above average. He came out of the gate this spring throwing much harder than in the past, showcasing a fastball consistently up to 97 mph. He backs it up with a mid-80s slider and an 86-88 mph cutter, though he hasn??t shown much of a changeup in the past. Garcia??s command has been spotty at times, but he??s generally around the strike zone, and given his athletic delivery and arm action, there??s some confidence he??ll improve on this front in the future. He doesn??t have a ton of track record against good competition ??? the stint on the Cape helped a bit ??? or as a starter, but he??s a relatively fresher arm with perhaps more projection than most college pitchers."
"Alejandro Rosario",71,"P","Miami Christian School","HS SR","Miami","FL","USA","R","R","Rosario was originally slated to be in the 2021 Draft class, but would have been 19 at the time, so the Miami-area prepster reclassified to be a part of this year??s Draft. He certainly got added to follow lists everywhere after showing off impressive arm strength at a number of summer showcase events, from the East Coast Pro Showcase to both the Under Armour All-America Game and the Perfect Game All-American Classic. While he is a bit undersized, Rosario is strong and athletic. He also has an extremely fast arm that was firing fastballs up to 97 mph all summer long, and touching 99 mph early this spring. He complements the heater with a splitter that takes on different shapes and forms, sometimes looking like a power pitch and sometimes looking like a bigger, looping breaking ball without the spin. It's very effective as an offspeed pitch and he is working on adding a cutter-like option to his arsenal. Scouts love how Rosario goes right after hitters, but there are concerns about whether he will have the repertoire and the command to be a starting pitcher. His delivery is OK, though he loses his release point at times, and he's more thrower than pitcher now. Pitchers who profile as relievers in high school are always harder to place on Draft boards, but the Miami recruit??s pure arm strength is sure to intrigue many teams."
"Ben Hernandez",72,"P","De La Salle Institute","HS SR","Chicago","IL","USA","R","R","The best pitcher in the inaugural Prospect Development Pipeline League, Hernandez spun six hitless innings over three outings while permitting just one walk and fanning seven. He also excelled at the Under Armour All-America Game, striking out the side in a perfect ninth inning. Part of a De La Salle Institute (Chicago) program that has produced four big leaguers, including outfielder/Hall of Fame umpire Jocko Conlan, he has committed to Illinois-Chicago and will be eligible for the 2022 Draft as a sophomore if he attends college. Hernandez finished each of his Under Armour whiffs with his devastating changeup, which ranks as the best in the 2020 high school class. It's a low-80s offering with filthy fade, and he'll throw it in any count and isn't afraid to double or triple up on it. He sets up his changeup with a 90-95 mph fastball that features some sink and plays up because he locates it well. Hernandez uses a decent mid-70s curveball as his third offering. There's not a lot of projection remaining in his strong 6-foot-2 frame, but he makes the most of what he has and exhibits advanced feel for pitching. His delivery features little effort and he repeats it well."
"Gage Workman",73,"3B","Arizona State","4YR JR","Chandler","AZ","USA","S","R","Originally slated to be part of the Class of 2018 out of Basha High School in Arizona, Workman reclassified and finished in 2017 instead, with the idea that he would head on his Mormon Mission, something his father Widd did in between two college stops and a four-year professional pitching career with the Padres and Dodgers. Instead, Workman headed to his father's second collegiate home, Arizona State, where he's been a starting infielder for two-plus years and had a solid performance in the Cape Cod League last summer. The 6-foot-4 switch-hitter is big, strong and athletic. He's better from the left side of the plate, both in terms of his approach at the plate and tapping into his excellent raw power. Overall, he's power over hit and needs to cut down on his strikeouts, work more counts and take more walks to become a more well-rounded offensive player. He's a solid-to-average runner, maybe a tick better underway, and he moves better than you'd think. He plays third at ASU in deference to Alika Williams, but Workman played short on the Cape and he could get the chance to play up the middle. He has the hands and arm strength to do it, but with his frame, third base seems a more likely long-term home. Because he graduated earlier than expected, Workman will be just 20 years old come Draft time, something that should work in his favor. So should his plus makeup, which will allow him to maximize his tools at the next level."
"Hudson Haskin",74,"OF","Tulane","4YR SO","New York","NY","USA","R","R","Avon (Conn.) Old Farms School produced an athletic center fielder in 2008 who went on to become a first-round pick after three years in college and an eventual star with the Astros -- George Springer. A decade later, the Beavers spawned another toolsy center fielder who should go early in the 2020 Draft as a sophomore-eligible. A 39th-round pick by the Athletics in 2018, Haskin batted .372/.459/.647 as a Tulane freshman and helped his cause by performing well with wood bats in the New England Collegiate Baseball League during the summer. Though Haskin's right-handed swing can get long at times, he still manages to barrel the ball consistently. His stroke is quick and has nice loft, and once he fills out his lean 6-foot-2 frame he could produce 20 or more homers annually. He manages the strike zone well, though his ability to make contact with ease does cut into his walks. Haskin's speed grades as at least plus. Though he broke Springer's stolen base record at Avon Old Farms, he hasn't been especially aggressive on the bases in college. He tracks balls well in center field, showing good instincts and an average arm."
"Owen Caissie",75,"OF","Notre Dame Catholic SS","HS SR","Burlington","ON","Canada","L","R","The Canadian province of Ontario has had a high school player taken in the top five rounds of every Draft since 2013, headlined by a pair of first-rounders in the Naylor brothers, Josh and Bo. While Caissie doesn??t project to be a first-round pick in this year??s Draft, he is one of two Canadian prep outfielders who have a very good chance to get taken in the first several rounds. Caissie, a Michigan recruit, has the tools to fit the right field profile very well, starting with his plus raw power. He has legit pop from the left side of the plate, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields. Some scouts have questioned his bat path, leading to some concerns about his ability to get to that power, but he has shown the ability to make adjustments in the past. He??s at least an above-average runner, one who gets to plus once underway. In deference to the other Canadian outfielder on this list, David Calabrese, Caissie has played a corner outfield spot for the Canadian junior national team. With an arm that delivers low-90s throws from the outfield and his power potential, he fits that mold very well. A team that thinks he has the chops to handle center, and he might, could consider him a bit higher."
"Petey Halpin",76,"OF","Mira Costa HS","HS SR","San Mateo","CA","USA","L","R","Halpin wasn't considered an elite-level player as the summer showcase circuit started last summer, as evidenced by him not getting an invite to either the Perfect Game All-American Classic or the Under Armour All-American Game. But a strong performance in the PDP League led to a spot at the MLB High School All-Star Game in Cleveland and he performed well later in the summer at the Area Code Games to put him more firmly on the map. The outfielder often displays impressive tools across the board. He's a plus runner, one who led the PDP League by going a perfect 6-for-6 in stolen base attempts, and that speed allows him to cover a lot of ground in the outfield. He also has a very strong arm, one that's been up to 92 mph off the mound. He makes loud contact consistently from the left side of the plate and while he's hit over power now, he's shown the ability to drive the ball and was launching balls out at Angels Stadium this past fall during the Angels Elite showcase, the same event where 2019 first-rounder Keoni Cavaco showed up for the first time. Halpin, who initially committed to UCLA but then decided to head out of state and play at Texas should the Draft not work out, might be underestimated by some scouts. Pete Crow-Armstrong is the more famous name among California prep outfielders, but don't be surprised if Halpin isn't all that far behind him."
"Jared Shuster",77,"P","Wake Forest","4YR JR","New Bedford","MA","USA","L","L","The state of North Carolina has three college pitchers who made big leaps into the first two or three rounds this spring, and Shuster qualifies as a bigger surprise than Duke right-hander Bryce Jarvis or North Carolina State lefty Nick Swiney. He posted a 6.79 ERA in his first two seasons with the Demon Deacons but had much more success in wood-bat summer leagues, earning all-star honors while improving his control and command in Cape Cod last year. When his stuff picked up this spring, he became Wake's best pitching prospect since Kyle Sleeth went No. 3 overall in 2003. Shuster operated at 88-92 mph as recently as last summer but pushed his fastball to 92-94 mph with a peak of 97 this spring, having more success with a riding four-seamer than he did with a sinking two-seamer. His changeup remains his best pitch, sitting around 80 mph with tumble, and he has the confidence to throw it in any count. He still doesn't show great feel for spinning the ball but has come up with a low-80s slurve as an effective third offering. Shuster doesn't have the cleanest delivery but has the strength to make it work and should hold up as a starter. He greatly enhanced his chances of remaining in the rotation long term by finding the strike zone. After issuing 5.2 walks per nine innings in his first two college seasons, he cut that rate to 1.4 between Cape and his truncated junior year."
"Nick Swiney",78,"P","North Carolina State","4YR JR","Nashville","TN","USA","R","L","Swiney went 11-1 as a middle reliever in his first two seasons at North Carolina State before moving to the rotation this spring. He won all of his four starts, giving up just four runs and six walks in the process, vaulting into consideration in the top three rounds of the Draft. Though he succeeded in a small sample size as a starter, he showed better stuff coming out of the bullpen, so his long-term role is uncertain. Working out of the rotation, Swiney showed an 87-93 mph fastball with modest life and an average to plus curveball. As a reliever in the past, he sat in the low 90s and topped out at 95 with his heater and backed it up with a wipeout curve. His changeup was a revelation this spring, showing signs of becoming a plus offering with deceptive fade. Swiney slashed his walk rate from 5.0 per nine innings in his first two years to 1.9 in his shortened third. There's still some question as to whether he can throw quality strikes and maintain his stuff over a long season because his delivery features effort. Nevertheless, he's the Wolfpack's best pitching prospect since Carlos Rodon was the No. 3 overall choice in the 2014 Draft."
"Zach DeLoach",79,"CF","Texas A&M","4YR JR","Irving","TX","USA","L","R","DeLoach's first two years in college were a tale of two seasons, as he batted .239 with five homers in two springs at Texas A&M and starred with wood bats in the summer Northwoods and Cape Cod leagues. After appearing to break out by winning the 2019 Cape batting title (.353), he returned to College Station and once again underwhelmed area scouts during fall practice. He beat up on a soft schedule during the truncated 2020 season, hitting .421 with six homers in 18 games and ranking 11th in NCAA Division I with a 1.336 OPS. A streaky hitter, DeLoach is at his best when he turns his left-handed swing loose, which he did more frequently during his brief junior year. He could go as high as the second round to a team that buys into the guy they saw on the Cape who drove the ball with authority with wood bats. He always has excelled at controlling the strike zone and putting the bat on the ball, but he too often adopted an almost defensive approach and settled for weak contact in his first two seasons with the Aggies. More of an average runner in the past, DeLoach flashed some plus times from home to first this spring. That helps his chances of staying in center field, though his so-so instincts likely will land him on a corner. His average to solid arm should fit in either left or right field, positions that will increase the demands on his bat."
"Zach McCambley",80,"P","Coastal Carolina","4YR JR","Netcong","NJ","USA","L","R","Coastal Carolina has produced just three top-three-rounds picks in the last 33 Drafts but could have two this year in McCambley and toolsy outfielder Parker Chavers (who was sidelined all spring following shoulder surgery). McCambley attracted scouting interest as a Pennsylvania high schooler, but had a minor knee injury as a senior and wasn't considered signable, so he went undrafted in 2017. He lacked consistency while bouncing between the rotation and bullpen in his first two seasons with the Chanticleers, but he helped his cause with a strong summer in the Cape Cod League. McCambley appeals to teams that love high spin rates, which he has on both his curveball and fastball. He owns one of the better curves in his Draft class, with his low-80s bender diving hard at the plate and earning well above-average grades at times. It plays well off his 90-94 mph heater that tops out at 96 and features riding action. To make it as a starter in pro ball, McCambley will need to refine his nascent changeup and improve his control and command. There's some effort in his three-quarters delivery that restricts him from locating his fastball where he wants, and his curveball breaks so much that more advanced hitters may refuse to chase it. If he can't stick in the rotation, he has the stuff to serve as a high-leverage reliever."
"Tyler Gentry",81,"RF","Alabama","4YR JR","Memphis","TN","USA","R","R","Undrafted out of a Tennessee high school, Gentry spent his freshman season at Walters State (Tenn.) CC and helped the Senators reach the finals of the 2018 Junior College World Series. He topped Alabama in most offensive categories in 2019 and again this spring, when he ranked among the NCAA Division I leaders in all three slash stats (.429/.554/.750) during the shortened season. He could go as early as the second round, which would make him the Crimson Tide's highest pick since Mikey White went there in 2015. Gentry's most attractive tool is his right-handed power, which carries to all fields and played against top competition in the Southeastern Conference and the Cape Cod League. He has an aggressive swing and approach, though he did a better job of controlling the strike zone during the brief 2020 season. He shows the ability to hit for both average and power if he maintains his plate discipline. Though it's his bat that will get him drafted, Gentry also offers some underrated athleticism. He has solid speed and arm strength, enabling him to provide quality defense in right field. He's capable of playing all three outfield positions and profiles best in right."
"Jake Vogel",82,"CF","Huntington Beach HS","HS SR","Newport Beach","CA","USA","R","R","Huntington Beach High School in Southern California has been a powerhouse for quite some time and it??s produced some high-end talent, most notably 2017 first-round pick Nick Pratto. Vogel isn??t quite at that level in terms of his Draft stock, but after missing the summer showcase circuit, he was moving up boards by showing off his considerable tools before the season was shut down. Compact and strong, Vogel is one of the fastest guys in the Draft class, occasionally recording 80 run times. Most believe he??s going to hit at the next level, with a really simple swing from the right side of the plate that allows him to barrel up the baseball on a consistent basis. Though he??s undersized, there is some pop there, and he??s shown the ability to drive the ball. His plus speed allows him to be a serious basestealing threat. Vogel??s speed allows him to cover a ton of ground in center field and he has an above-average arm from the outfield as well. Because he wasn??t seen over the summer, the UCLA commit??s tools surprised some people earlier this spring. That could lead to him being taken in the top three rounds."
"Chase Davis",83,"OF","Franklin HS","HS SR","Sacramento","CA","USA","L","L","Elk Grove in northern California has produced a fair amount of professional baseball talent, with eventual first rounders like Dylan Carlson and Nick Madrigal hailing from Elk Grove High School. While Davis attends Franklin High School, he does have the chance to be the next early-round pick from Elk Grove and the highest pick ever from Franklin. Davis is a strong and athletic outfielder with a chance to hit. He has plus raw power from the left side of the plate and while his stock increased over the summer when he showed the ability to make consistent hard contact against top-level competition at multiple events with very quick hands and bat speed, concerns about his ability to hit enough to get to that power resurfaced early this spring. He can get out of sync at times and he'll have to show he can be consistently on time with his swing at the next level. Davis runs well and would be a good fit in right field at the next level with a cannon arm. It will be Davis' bat that will be his carrying tool and will get him considered in the top few rounds of the Draft. The Arizona recruit should easily become the earliest-drafted Franklin High product ever, beating Josh Pigg, a 28th-round pick in 2012."
"Markevian Hence",84,"P","Watson Chapel HS","HS SR","Pine Bluff","AR","USA","R","R","The state of Arkansas has had just three high school pitchers drafted in the first three rounds in the last two decades, none since the Indians made Dillon Howard a second-rounder in 2011. Hence thrust himself into that neighborhood when he broke out during the fall. He hit 94 mph with his fastball at the Future Stars Series in September and then kicked his heater up to 96 at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. Hence lacks physicality but compensates with quick-twitch athleticism and a fast arm. His fastball sat at 93-95 mph with heavy sink during his WWBA outing and he displayed similar velocity during a brief look this spring before the high school season ended. He also shows aptitude for spinning the ball, flashing a plus slider at 76-81 mph, and demonstrates some feel for a changeup. Hence's arsenal, athleticism and ability to repeat his sound delivery give him a chance to remain a starter despite his small frame. The Arkansas recruit will be 17 on Draft day, adding to his appeal for teams that place a premium on age."
"Sam Weatherly",85,"P","Clemson","4YR JR","Ann Arbor","MI","USA","L","L","Projectable pitchers Jeff Criswell and Weatherly were Michigan's best high school prospects three years ago and now are poised to go in the top three rounds after going to college at Michigan and Clemson, respectively. After turning down the Blue Jays as a 27th-round pick, Weatherly has gone from two-way player to reliever to starter with the Tigers. He was spectacular in the brief 2020 season, allowing two runs in four starts while ranking among the NCAA Division I leaders in opponent average (.096, seventh), strikeouts (43, seventh) and strikeout rate (17.1 per nine innings, eighth). Weatherly's best pitch is a low-80s slider that consistently grades as plus and can wipe out both left-handers and right-handers. He sets it up with a 91-94 mph fastball that tops out at 96 with good spin rates that create riding life that leads to swings and misses up in the strike zone. His changeup is improving as he uses it more often as a starter and shows the makings of an average third pitch. Weatherly has the stuff to start and a 6-foot-4 frame built for durability. He's also more athletic than most pitchers and his arm works well, which makes his struggles to throw strikes baffling. He commands his slider better than his fastball and will land in the bullpen if he can't do a better job of finding the zone."
"A.J. Vukovich",86,"3B","East Troy HS","HS SR","Mukwonago","WI","USA","R","R","The state of Wisconsin has produced several recent hitters of note, including current Top 100 Prospects Gavin Lux (Dodgers), Jarred Kelenic (Mariners) and Daulton Varsho (Diamondbacks). The next in line is Vukovich, who won't go in the first round out of high school like Lux and Kelenic but does offer some of the best high school power in the 2020 Draft. He finished second to Blaze Jordan at the High School Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game last July. Vukovich has long levers and a lot of projectable strength in his 6-foot-5 frame, which combine with the bat speed and loft in his right-handed stroke to produce well above-average raw power. His swing can get long and he employs a leg kick to help generate his pop, leading to some concerns about his ability to make consistent contact against quality pitching. He struggled at the Area Code Games in August and batted just .167 for the U.S. national team at the under-18 World Cup in September. Scouts also aren't sold that Vukovich will be able to stay at third base, where he lacks quickness but does display solid arm strength. A basketball star who averaged 27.8 points and 13.1 rebounds per game while making second-team all-state as a senior, he moves well for his size and is athletic enough to handle an outfield corner, though some evaluators project him as a first baseman. If he follows through on his commitment to Louisville, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2022."
"Colt Keith",87,"3B","Biloxi HS","HS SR","Zanesville","OH","USA","L","R","Gatorade's Mississippi high school player of the year as a junior last spring after moving from Arizona, Keith is one of the top two-way talents in the 2020 Draft. Scouts are divided as to whether he's a better prospect as a pitcher or an infielder, though they believe he prefers to play every day. A sore arm prevented him from pitching in midsummer showcase events but he did return to the mound and impressed in the fall. Keith makes consistent hard contact from the left side of the plate and is beginning to tap into his solid raw power, the product of bat speed and leverage. Projected strength gains should add more pop but also may slow him down enough to necessitate a move from shortstop in high school to third base in pro ball. The Arizona State recruit is an average runner whose plus arm will play on the left side of the infield. As a right-handed pitcher, Keith operates with an 89-93 mph fastball and uses his size and high three-quarters delivery to create downhill plane. His upper-70s curveball features good depth, while his changeup is more of a work in progress. His arm works well and there's plenty of projection remaining in his athletic 6-foot-3 frame."
"Ian Bedell",88,"P","Missouri","4YR JR","Davenport","IA","USA","R","R","Bedell is an attractive target for clubs that favor youth and performance. He was Iowa's top 2018 prep prospect until he graduated a semester ahead of schedule to enroll early at Missouri, which will make him one of the youngest college players (20 years, 9 months) in the 2020 Draft. After posting a 1.56 ERA as a sophomore reliever last spring, he dominated even more as a starter in the Cape Cod League (0.59 ERA, .383 opponent OPS, 36/3 K/BB ratio) and continued to pound the strike zone in that role this spring. Bedell's two- and four-seam fastballs sat in the low 90s when he started on the Cape, with sink or run depending on which version he used. He worked more in the upper 80s in cold weather during the truncated 2020 season, but his heater continued to play up because of his command. There's debate as to whether his fading low-80s changeup or his slightly slower curveball is his best secondary pitch, and he also can mix in a mid-80s cutter. Bedell has a sound delivery and the athleticism to repeat it with ease. He attacks hitters with confidence because he can locate his pitches where he wants. Fellow Missouri hurler T.J. Sikkema rode pitchability and a high floor into the supplemental first round in 2019, and Bedell could take a similar path this year."
"Christian Roa",89,"P","Texas A&M","4YR JR","Houston","TX","USA","R","R","After an impressive fall and a pair of dominant starts in which he averaged two strikeouts per inning to open 2020, Roa started generating top-three-round buzz. His stuff and command fell off against better competition in his next two outings before the season abruptly ended, leaving clubs unsure what exactly to make of him. Nevertheless, he and projected top-five-overall pick Asa Lacy give Texas A&M its best lefty-righty prospect duo since Chance Caple and Casey Fossum went in the first 48 selections in 1999. Roa initially sat at 92-94 mph with his fastball this spring, peaking at 96 with some armside run before his heater lost a couple of ticks of velocity and straightened out. All three of his secondary pitches are at least solid when he's at his best. Scouts debate whether his hard 11-5 curveball or fading, sinking changeup is better, while his low-80s slider is his least consistent offering. Roa has thrown strikes throughout his college career, averaging 2.0 walks per nine innings until issuing eight free passes in nine frames in his final two starts. Even before his late downturn, his control was significantly ahead of his command, so he'll have to do a better job of locating his pitches. He uses his strong 6-foot-4 build and an overhand delivery to create difficult downhill angle."
"Gavin Williams",90,"P","East Carolina","4YR JR","Fayetteville","NC","USA","L","R","Williams had one of the most projectable fastballs in the 2017 high school class, reaching 95 mph as a lanky 6-foot-6 North Carolinian who threw no-hitters in his first two starts. After signability concerns dropped him to the Rays in the 30th round, he headed to East Carolina, where he hit 100 mph as a freshman. But he never could secure a spot in the Pirates' rotation and worked just three innings this spring while battling a finger injury, leaving him a live-armed enigma for this year's Draft. He wasn't at full strength yet this spring but Williams worked at 94-99 mph with some running action on his fastball during longer stints last fall. He hasn't demonstrated much feel for spinning the ball, though he has made some progress with a mid-70s curveball that varies from a soft slurve to a solid offering. He shows more aptitude for using an 85-88 mph changeup to throw off hitters trying to sit on his heater. Williams has a strong, athletic frame and has cleaned up his delivery some since high school, though he has yet to provide strikes on a consistent basis. He did a better job of pounding the zone last fall but didn't get a chance to show what he could do as a full-time member of the rotation this spring. He still could go in the first three rounds and will get a chance to start in pro ball, though it's likely that he ends up as a reliever."
"Mason Erla",91,"P","Michigan State","4YR JR","Bay City","MI","USA","R","R","Erla bounced back from blowing out his knee playing football as a Michigan high school senior to claiming a spot in Michigan State's weekend rotation as a freshman in 2017, but that season ended when he tore his lat in his second outing. He displayed mostly generic stuff and went undrafted as a redshirt sophomore in 2019 before dominating in four starts this spring. Erla's strikeout rate jumped to 14.2 per nine innings from 6.7 a year ago and his Draft stock soared as well, making him the Spartans' best pitching prospect since Mark Mulder went No. 2 overall in 1998. After working at 88-92 mph for much of 2019, Erla eschewed playing in a summer league to focus on building up his arm strength -- and it worked. His fastball sat at 93-95 this spring and topped out at 98 with riding action that keeps it off barrels. He has improved his slider too, pushing it into the mid-80s, and can turn it into a cutter in the upper 80s. Erla also shows some aptitude for throwing a changeup with sink and run. With his upgraded stuff, he's doing a better job of attacking hitters and throwing strikes. He has been durable since his lat injury and has an efficient delivery, so there's no reason he can't remain a starter."
"Ricky Tiedemann",92,"P","Lakewood HS","HS SR","Long Beach","CA","USA","L","L","The 2020 high school season was obviously short-lived. But in a brief amount of time, Tiedemann, the younger brother of Rangers Minor League right-hander Tai Tiedemann, created a good amount of buzz and Draft helium. The left-hander??s stuff and projection had scouts excited, even though a broken non-throwing arm in a collision at first base kept his looks even more limited. Tiedemann??s stuff all ticked up out of the gate this spring and he has the chance to have three average to above-average pitches when all is said and done. His fastball is 88-92 mph now, touching 93 mph, but as a two-way player who hit third in his high school lineup, his athleticism and lean frame all point to much more in the tank velocity-wise. He has a really good feel for his changeup, which could be a plus pitch in time, and while his breaking ball is his third pitch, he does show a feel to spin a future average offering. Tiedemann can throw strikes with all three and that athleticism should help him continue to repeat his delivery and command his stuff even as he throws harder. While there??s not a lot of track record in terms of teams scouting the left-hander, his name was definitely moving up boards in a hurry and was being mentioned among the best prep southpaws in the class. Compared by some, body type wise, to Sean Manaea, Tiedemann could go early enough to be signed away from his commitment to San Diego State."

That will change this June, because Bohrofen should fit in the top three rounds if he's signable away from an Oklahoma commitment. He's one of the better offensive prospects and has one of the highest floors in the 2020 high school class. Bohrofen has a knack for barreling the ball with a quick, compact, left-handed swing and a track record of producing on the showcase circuit, though he didn't help his cause by regressing to a more uphill stroke in brief action this spring. He hasn't fully grown into his power yet but could develop into a 25-homer threat thanks to his penchant for making hard contact and backspinning the ball. While he has clocked sub-6.6-second 60-yard dash times at showcase events, his speed plays closer to average on the diamond. Though it's Bohrofen's offensive upside that attracts scouts, he's a well-rounded player. His instincts give him an outside chance to stick in center field and if he can't, he can be a solid right fielder with arm strength to match. He also earns praise for his baseball IQ and makeup."
"Connor Phillips",94,"P","McLennan CC","JC J1","Houston","TX","USA","R","R","Phillips came on late last spring as a Texas high school senior, turning down offers of third-round money and lasting until the Blue Jays took him in the 35th round. Originally committed to Louisiana State, he switched to McLennan (Texas) CC so he'd be Draft-eligible again as a freshman. He threw very well early in the junior college season before his command eluded him in his final two outings in March. Phillips has a quick arm that produces 92-96 mph fastballs that peak at 98 and he already shows the ability to hold his velocity deep into games. His upper-70s curveball has good depth and shows signs of becoming a plus pitch, though he can't always land it for strikes. He'll need to refine his changeup as he faces more advanced hitters. There's still some projection remaining in Phillips' 6-foot-2 frame, so he could add more velocity. He sometimes gets hit harder than his stuff would indicate he should because there's effort in his delivery that hampers his command, and his long arm action and high three-quarters slot allow hitters to see the ball well. He's far from a finished product but comes with plenty of upside."
"Beck Way",95,"P","Northwest Florida State","JC J2","Harrisburg","PA","USA","R","R","A product of Mechanicsburg High School outside of Harrisburg, Pa., Way began his college career at Division II Belmont Abbey. After a season pitching in the bullpen there, Way transferred to Northwest Florida Junior College. He jumped on the map with a strong showing as a reliever in the Cape Cod League last summer and then jumped into the rotation this spring, raising his profile even more. Long and lean, Way uses a three-quarters delivery to bring three pitches which have the chance to be average or better. He??ll throw his fastball in the 91-95 mph range and can reach back for a tick or two more. His slider is very good when he stays on top of the low-80s breaking ball, but he can get under it at times. He doesn??t use his mid-80s changeup much, but he??s athletic enough to believe it will be an effective offering in the future. In the past, Way had struggled with his command, but in a starting role this spring, he was much more consistent in finding the strike zone. The team that takes him early enough to keep him from moving on to LSU will think the projectable right-hander has the chance to start long-term, knowing that the fastball-slider combination will work really well out of a bullpen."
"Brandon Birdsell",96,"P","San Jacinto College North","JC J1","Conroe","TX","USA","R","R","Birdsell pushed his fastball into the low 90s as a Willis (Texas) High freshman but blew out his elbow as a sophomore and missed his junior season following Tommy John surgery. He regained his stuff in 2018 and could have gone in the top 10 rounds on talent, but his Texas A&M commitment pushed him down to the Astros in the 39th round. He worked just seven innings in his lone year with the Aggies, prompting a transfer to San Jacinto (Texas) JC, where he pitched well enough to give him a chance to become the first junior college player selected in 2020. Birdsell opened his sophomore season by working in the low 90s before dealing at 94-95 mph and peaking at 97 in his final start of the season, demonstrating more downhill plane than life on his fastball. After featuring a loopy breaking ball in high school and not showing much more feel for spin at Texas A&M, he has come up with a mid-80s slider/cutter and a low-80s power slurve. He shows glimpses of at least an average changeup with some fade but doesn't use it often. He doesn't come with much track record -- just 36 innings in two college seasons -- but Birdsell has the ingredients to become a big leaguer. He has a strong frame and a low-effort delivery that provides plenty of strikes. If he doesn't sign this summer, he'll pitch at Texas Tech in 2021."
"David Calabrese",97,"OF","St. Elizabeth Catholic HS","HS SR","Richmond Hill","ON","Canada","L","R","There has been a player from Ontario taken in the top three rounds of the Draft every year since 2014, including a pair of first-rounders in the Naylor brothers, Josh and Bo. Calabrese, a speedy outfielder who was initially slated to be a 2021 product but reclassified for this year and who was named to the Canadian Junior National Team this fall, hopes to keep that streak going in 2020. While Calabrese is not the biggest guy in the world at 5-foot-10, he has some tools sure to attract attention. His speed stands out the most and it's close to top of the scale, with some evaluators recording 80 grades for the outfielder. It should allow him to be a basestealing threat and to cover a lot of ground in the outfield. At the plate, the left-handed hitter has a loose and easy swing geared for hard contact. He's a gap-to-gap hitter who can use the whole field who has come on fast offensively and while his game is really built around his speed and defense, he could grow into more power as he matures. He has adequate arm strength and it plays up because he makes accurate throws. It's more than enough for center field, where he should be able to play long-term. Calabrese committed to Arkansas in the fall, and the Razorbacks might hope he can develop into another Andrew Benintendi type if he gets to campus. A team that feels the same way might try to sign him away from that commitment, with many organizations likely to like the fact he'll still be just 17 years old at the Draft."
"Nick Frasso",98,"P","Loyola Marymount University","4YR JR","Torrance","CA","USA","R","R","Coming out of Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in Southern California, Frasso was a tall and gangly basketball player and pitcher with a ton of upside, but who had difficulty making the transition from one sport to the next, which kept his velocity down for much of the spring. He looked like the type of pitching prospect who needed college, and that's proven to be true. Focusing on baseball at Loyola Marymount, he's started catching up to his upside over his first two years, though an elbow injury suffered before the shutdown put his Draft stock a bit more in question. Frasso pitched mostly in relief as a sophomore so he could have more of a regular impact, and ended up saving 10 games. But he began his junior year as a starter, with the chance to work on his three-pitch mix. The velocity is now there consistently when healthy, and the 6-foot-5 right-hander is up to 97 mph with his fastball. He's lived off his four-seamer up in the zone almost entirely during his college career and it misses a ton of bats, as it has tremendous life. He has a sweeping 74-76 mph curve that can be effective at times as he tunnels it off of his fastball and shows some glimpses of an 80-82 mph changeup. Very thin with a herky jerky delivery, Frasso is athletic enough to repeat it consistently and throw a good amount of strikes, even if he's not a pinpoint command guy. Had he been able to prove he could start, he would have likely made a jump up Draft boards. The injury clouded things further, though he was reportedly throwing and working his way back when the season stopped. Pro teams could still send him out as a starter, knowing that he's very effective out of the bullpen as well."
"Victor Mederos",99,"P","Westminster Christian School","HS SR","Santa Clara",NA,"Cuba","R","R","Mederos fled Cuba with his mother and older brother to join his father in Miami when he was just six years old, a harrowing experience that has undoubtedly helped shape his perspective as a player. The confident right-hander has a true passion for the game and the stuff to match it, allowing him to stand out at a number of summer showcase events, including taking home MVP honors at the Under Armour All-America Game. The 6-foot-3 Mederos has a big, strong and durable frame and three pitches that have the chance to be average or better in the future. He was up to 96 mph consistently all summer, but while his arm action worked well at those events, questions about his delivery and body popped up early this spring. His breaking ball is at its best when it's a power slider, which has been up to 85-87 mph at times, but he can add and subtract from it to make it more like a slower curve. He has decent feel for a changeup with sink, though he doesn't throw it a lot. One remaining question mark about Mederos, who switched from Monsignor Pace High School to Westminster Christian Academy for his senior year in order to be closer to home, is his health. He didn't pitch much at all during his junior year because of arm issues, though he showed no ill effects over the summer and didn??t really get the chance to show how durable he is this spring."
"Freddy Zamora",100,"SS","Miami","4YR JR","Managua",NA,"Nicaragua","R","R","Freddy Zamora Sr. played professional baseball in Nicaragua and his son has the chance to play at a much higher level. The younger Zamora had been a starter since he set foot on Miami's campus, and after being a glove-only type of middle infielder, improvements in his offensive game had him much higher on Draft boards as he was set to begin his junior season with the Hurricanes. That progress came to a screeching halt when he was first suspended for violating team rules before the start of the season, then suffered a knee injury in practice that will shelved him for the rest of the year.  At his best, Zamora has the skill set to be an everyday player at a premium position. He can be a plus defender at times, with a lot of body control, range and wing span at his disposal to go along with an easily plus arm. He's made strides at the plate to make him a more well-rounded player. He's very short to the ball with a contact-oriented approach that makes him tough to strike out, and he started showing more extra-base pop during his sophomore year, though he tailed off at the end of the year. Zamora is an average runner, especially once underway, and he's shown the ability to steal bases, though he was nursing a hamstring injury this fall and will have to show there are no ill-effects from the knee injury. He can play with a low motor at times, but with his overall skill set, and he??ll now have to answer questions about his makeup, but he has the tools to be a top three-round talent."
"Milan Tolentino",101,"SS","Santa Margarita HS","HS SR","Mission Viejo","CA","USA","L","R","In 1983, Jose Tolentino helped the University of Texas win the College World Series alongside stars like Roger Clemens and Calvin Schiraldi before embarking on a 15-year professional career that included one year in the big leagues. Now a broadcaster for the Angels, his son is making a name for himself as one of the better high school middle infielders in the Class of 2020. Tolentino has the chance to hit and be a big league regular shortstop. There's no question about his defensive ability, with a plus arm and the feet and actions to stick at the premium position long term. How much he'll hit will determine what kind of overall prospect he is. He's a tough out with an opposite-field approach who sees a lot of pitches and makes a lot of contact with a Johnny Damon-like swing. He does roll over balls to the pull side at times and doesn't barrel up the ball consistently enough with wood. He has added some strength to his lower half, giving some scouts hope that he'll add some extra-base authority as he matures. The UCLA recruit does make the most of his abilities with a high baseball IQ, and the team that thinks he??ll impact the ball consistently will be the one to take him in the early rounds."
"Carter Baumler",102,"P","Dowling Catholic HS","HS SR","Des Moines","IA","USA","R","R","Baumler boosted his stock late in the showcase cycle, pitching well at the Area Code Games in August and turning in an impressive bullpen workout at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in September. Iowa's best high school pitching prospect since Mitch Keller, he could be the state's earliest Draft pick since the Pirates made Keller a second-rounder in 2014. But he only got one disappointing outing in this spring before the coronavirus shutdown, making it unlikely a team will spend enough to lure him away from his Texas Christian commitment. Baumler has a strong, athletic frame that currently produces 90-94 mph fastballs with riding life and he projects to add more velocity in the future. His curveball lacked consistency early in the summer but improved afterward, showing good depth and leading some evaluators to grade his bender as a future plus offering. He hasn't used his changeup much but demonstrates some feel for the pitch. Scouts love Baumler's clean delivery and arm action, which should allow him to throw strikes and stay healthy. He's a quality athlete who has flashed some power and speed while playing a variety of positions, including catcher. Though he drew some college football interest after kicking and punting for Dowling Catholic's (Des Moines) 4-A state championship football team in 2018, he committed to play baseball only at TCU."
"Enrique Bradfield",103,"OF","American Heritage School (Plantation)","HS SR","Pembroke Pines","FL","USA","L","L","Bradfield entered the summer showcase circuit a bit of a question mark. The American Heritage outfielder had missed a bulk of his junior season with a back injury, so there were questions to be answered. He started answering them with a strong showing in Major League Baseball's PDP League, and he picked up the first-ever hit in the MLB High School All-Star Game in Cleveland. Bradfield's carrying tool is his top-of-the-scale speed and the left-handed hitter uses it to beat out infield ground balls and bunts for hits, to take extra bases regularly, to steal bases and to cover a ton of ground in center field. Bradfield knows his game is to see pitches, get on base, put the ball in play and let his legs do the rest as a kind of old school leadoff type hitter. There isn't much power to speak of, though he did drive the ball a bit during PDP League play. There is no question he'll play center field for a long time with an average arm and plus range. He is a fundamentally sound player with plus makeup. Bradfield can be a bit of a polarizing prospect because of a lack of physicality and questions over his ability to add strength. Some see a future Juan Pierre or even Kenny Lofton type, a guy who can sit atop a big league lineup for a long time. Others see more of a Derrick Robinson type, a speedster who never really hit enough to stick. A team will have to believe he fits the former description in order to sign him away from his commitment to Vanderbilt."
"Jackson Miller",104,"C","J.W. Mitchell HS","HS SR","New Port Richey","FL","USA","L","R","While left-handed-hitting catchers are always a hot commodity come Draft time, taking high school backstops always comes with some risks. Miller is a half-step behind some of the top high school catchers in the Class of 2020, but he has the chance to be the best one to come out of Florida since MJ Melendez was taken in the second round of the 2017 Draft by the Royals. Miller has the chance to be a good all-around catcher who is more athletic than most backstops. At the plate, he has a really good approach with strong strike-zone awareness, typically using a line-drive, up-the-middle philosophy. He's physical with some current strength and the kind of frame that should allow him to get stronger, so seeing him grow into average power isn't unreasonable, especially once he learns to leverage and loft the ball. He runs better than most catchers and is very aggressive on the basepaths. While he needs some work with receiving and blocking, he has the agility and hands to be a good defensive catcher, and he has an above-average arm. High school catchers can take a while to develop, but the team that signs Miller away from his Wake Forest commitment could get a starting big league catcher in the future."
"Alerick Soularie",105,"CF","Tennessee","4YR JR","Houston","TX","USA","R","R","Scouts have admired Soularie's bat for a while but have had a hard time fitting the rest of his game into a profile. He went undrafted as a Texas prepster in 2017 and went in the 29th round to the Cardinals a year later after hitting .402/.513/.745 with 10 homers and 23 steals at San Jacinto (Texas) JC. After verbally committing to Arkansas and then-recruiting coordinator Tony Vitello out of high school, he reunited with Vitello (now the head coach at Tennessee) in 2019 and finished second in the Southeastern Conference in on-base percentage (.466) and third in batting (.357) and slugging (.602). Soularie has excellent feel for recognizing and barreling pitches, making consistent line-drive contact to all fields while controlling the strike zone. His right-handed swing isn't geared for home runs, though he makes the most of his average to solid raw power, and his hitting ability could translate into 20 homers per year. While he possesses just fringy speed, he's aggressive on the bases. Though scouts have regarded Soularie as a tweener who lacks the quickness for center fielder and the power to start on a corner, his track record of production could land him in the top three rounds. A center field at San Jac, he played left field as a sophomore and his instincts enhanced his range. He has below-average arm strength but showed reliable hands when he took ground balls at second base in the fall."
"Zavier Warren",106,"SS","Central Michigan","4YR JR","Southfield","MI","USA","S","R","Central Michigan hasn't had a position player taken in the first five rounds since 1980, but that drought will end this year. Warren impressed with his hitting and on-base ability in the Mid-American Conference last season, then established himself as a quality prospect by doing the same in the Cape Cod League. He spent some time behind the plate for the Chippewas this spring, adding to his intrigue. A switch-hitter with a quick, sound swing from both sides, Warren makes line-drive contact with ease. He's more of a gap-to-gap hitter than a home run threat, though he did set a school record with 22 doubles last year. He's not afraid to work deep counts in the pursuit of walks, and plays quicker than his fringy-to-average speed thanks to aggressiveness on the bases. Warren's future defensive home is in question because his so-so range and funky arm action aren't suited for shortstop. His solid arm could help make him an asset at third base (where he played on the Cape) if he shows enough power to profile there, or he could wind up as an offensive second baseman. There are mixed reviews on him as a catcher, his high school position, though he has the hands, arm and athleticism to possibly make it work with more experience."
"Parker Chavers",107,"CF","Coastal Carolina","4YR JR","Montgomery","AL","USA","L","R","Chavers has some of the better all-around tools in this year's college class, but he didn't get to show what he could do this spring after having surgery on his right (throwing) shoulder in December. He had a chance to play his way into the top two rounds with a big junior season after hitting 22 homers and stealing 19 bases in his first two seasons at Coastal Carolina. He also displayed power and speed during a strong summer in the Cape Cod League, though there are some questions about his ability to translate his tools into skills. With a quick left-handed swing and a strong if compact frame, Chavers generates solid raw power. He gets overly aggressive at the plate, however, hunting home runs with an uphill swing and a pull-heavy approach. He'll need to prove that he can make consistent contact and handle left-handers to do damage at the next level. Chavers possesses plus speed but is still a work in progress on the bases and in the outfield. Scouts are split on whether he has the instincts to handle center field in pro ball, and he scuffled at times as a right fielder on the Cape. His solid arm fits at all three outfield positions."
"Jordan Nwogu",108,"CF","Michigan","4YR JR","Ottawa","ON","Canada","R","R","A top-notch student who drew interest from college football programs as an edge rusher, Nwogu opted to stay home in Ann Arbor to play baseball and study computer engineering at Michigan. He was the Wolverines' best offensive performer in 2019, when they surprisingly finished second at the College World Series, and again this spring. One of the most physical players in this year's Draft, he offers more offensive upside than former Michigan outfielder Jordan Brewer, an Astros third-rounder last June. Nwogu packs prodigious strength in his 6-foot-3, 235-pound frame and generates impressive exit velocities, showing the ability to crush fastballs out of any part of any ballpark. He has an unorthodox but quick right-handed swing and his lower half seems out of sync with the rest of his body, but his impressive hand-eye coordination makes it work. He controls the strike zone reasonably well but still has to show he can make adjustments to handle breaking balls and changeups. Nwogu has plus speed and runs the bases aggressively. His quickness doesn't play nearly as well in the outfield, where he doesn't get good jumps and struggles going back on balls. His arm strength has improved in college but is still fringy, so he'll likely wind up in left field after playing center this spring in place of the injured Jesse Franklin."
"Bryce Elder",109,"P","Texas","4YR JR","Decatur","TX","USA","R","R","Better known as a golfer for much of his career at Decatur (Texas) High, Elder didn't play baseball as a freshman and was set to attend Howard (Texas) JC until a pair of no-hitters in the state playoffs as a senior helped land him at Texas. A reliever on the Longhorns' 2018 College World Series team as a freshman, he has served as their No. 1 starter the last two seasons. He doesn't light up radar guns but has one of the higher floors among this year's college pitchers, which could land him in the first three rounds. Elder's out pitch is a quick mid-80s slider that he'll use in any count. He has feel for manipulating the spin on his pitches, which also gives him a distinct curveball that's tight and features more downward break. His sinker sat in the low 90s more often this spring, ranging from 88-95 mph, and he also employs a changeup that can be an average offering but gets a bit firm at times. Elder provides strikes with all four pitches and they tunnel well together, allowing the sum of his repertoire to play better than its individual parts. He has a strong 6-foot-2 frame and repeats his delivery well, giving him the durability to remain in the rotation. Scouts love his mound presence, which adds to his chances of becoming a No. 4 or 5 starter."
"Anthony Servideo",110,"SS","Ole Miss","4YR JR","Jupiter","FL","USA","L","R","Servideo played sparingly as a Mississippi freshman in 2018, then spent most of 2019 shuttling between right field and center field for the Rebels before posting the worst batting line (.149/.228/.277) in the Cape Cod League. He looked like a different player this spring, starting on Opening Day by singling, doubling and walking against Louisville left-hander Reid Detmers, a lock top-10-overall pick. He emerged as one of college baseball's better shortstops, though scouts can only wonder how his .390/.575/.695 line would have held up in Southeastern Conference play. Servideo plays a table-setting role, working counts to draw walks (his 24 in 17 games ranked second in NCAA Division I) and aggressively using his plus speed to create havoc once he reaches base. To remain at the top of the order at the next level, he'll need to cut down his left-handed swing a bit and make more consistent contact. He's not big and won't be a slugger, but he displayed more pop as a junior, homering five times after going deep just four times in 100 previous contests. While there still are mixed opinions on how much impact Servideo will have at the plate, there are no questions about his ability to play shortstop. His quickness and solid arm make him a better defender than Grae Kessinger, his predecessor as Mississippi's shortstop and the Astros' second-round pick last June. If he doesn't hit enough to be a regular, he'd be capable of playing anywhere in the infield and outfield as a utility man."
"Slade Wilks",111,"RF","Columbia Academy","HS SR","Hattiesburg","MS","USA","L","R","DeSoto Central High's (Southaven) Blaze Jordan is one of the best sluggers and most famous players in the 2020 Draft, and Biloxi High's Colt Keith is one of the top two-way talents, yet there are some scouts who believe that Wilks is the best prep prospect in Mississippi. Their thinking is that he makes more contact than Jordan and has more power than Keith, so he has a greater chance to make an impact at the big league level. He began playing for the Columbia Academy varsity in the seventh grade and slammed 41 homers in his first three full high school seasons before going deep six times in 10 games this spring. Wilks provides plenty of raw power thanks to his combination of bat speed, strength and loft in his left-handed swing. He generally makes hard contact and produces impressive exit velocities, prompting some Jeromy Burnitz comparisons. Evaluators who aren't as sold on him worry about the length and aggressiveness of his stroke, questioning if he'll be able to get to all of his pop. Other concerns include Wilks' relatively advanced age (he turns 19 in May) and the three knee surgeries he had by the age of 15. He has bounced back from those operations to display average speed as well as similar arm strength, making him a capable defender on either outfield corner. If he decides to attend Southern Mississippi, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2022."
"Landon Knack",112,"P","East Tennessee State","4YR SR","Johnson City","TN","USA","L","R","The best fifth-year-senior prospect in years, Knack could go as early as the second or third round to a team looking to marry intriguing talent with a deep discount to create bonus pool wiggle room in a shortened Draft. He tore the labrum in his right (pitching) shoulder diving into a base and required surgery as a Tennessee high school senior in 2015 that led to him redshirting in his first year at Walters State (Tenn.) CC. He dislocated his left shoulder diving into a bag when he returned in 2017, costing him most of that year, before bouncing back to go 13-0 and hit 11 homers while leading the Senators to a runner-up finish at the 2018 Junior College World Series. Knack continued to win and pound the strike zone at East Tennessee State last spring but went undrafted for the fourth straight year, then took a dramatic leap forward in stuff and performance this spring. He won all four of his starts with a 1.08 ERA and led NCAA Division I in strikeouts (51 in 25 innings) and K-BB ratio (51-1). The quality of Knack's pitches improved somewhat when he gave up hitting in 2019, but he still operated with an 89-92 mph fastball and fringy secondary pitches. After a summer spent lifting weights and firming up his burly 6-foot-2 frame, he worked at 93-95 mph deep into games and touched 98 during the shortened season. He tightened his slider into a consistently solid offering, added power to what had been a get-me-over curveball and continued to demonstrate feel for his changeup. Knack doesn't have the prettiest body or delivery but has a long history of throwing strikes, averaging 1.3 walks per nine innings throughout his college career. The brother-in-law of Pirates 2016 first-rounder Will Craig, he presents a conundrum to teams because he turns 23 in July and his history of premium velocity lasts just four weeks. It's an unusual story for sure, but few pitchers in this Draft can match the stuff and command he showed this spring."
"Cayden Wallace",113,"3B","Greenbrier HS","HS SR","Little Rock","AR","USA","R","R","Arkansas has locked down all of the top in-state talents for its 2020 recruiting class, with Wallace the headliner among the position players. As a rising junior, he produced some of the best exit velocity at the 2018 World Wood Bat Association World Championship, and he remains one of the better power hitters in his class. He wasn't at his best during a truncated senior season, though his slugging upside still could land him in the top three or four rounds. Wallace generates pop to all fields with bat speed, strength and a relatively short right-handed swing. His power stands out more than his pure hitting ability, though he makes enough consistent contact to do damage. He runs well for his size and can flash solid speed once he's underway. While he'll have to continue to improve his defense, Wallace should be able to stay at third base. He has reliable hands and a strong arm that has produced fastballs up to 93 mph when he has taken the mound. His footwork needs to get better but he has demonstrated the work ethic to make that happen."
"Trent Palmer",114,"P","Jacksonville University","4YR JR","Rochester","MN","USA","R","R","Jacksonville University has produced a lot of Draft talent over the past several years, including back-to-back third-round picks Michael Baumann (2017) and Austin Hays (2016), both with the Baltimore Orioles. While Palmer obviously hasn??t been as scouted as any of his Dolphins predecessors, his arm strength and strong start to his spring, not to mention a successful turn as a reliever last summer on Cape, has his name popping up in the same area of the Draft. While not a prototype for a starting pitcher size-wise (6-foot-1, 230 pounds), some scouts do feel he has the chance to stick in a rotation because of his ability to maintain velocity and have a three- or four-pitch mix. He throws his fastball in the 91-96 mph range with good sink and he backs it up with a pair of solid secondary offerings. His changeup is a splitter thrown with good arm speed and downward action in the 82-84 mph range, and he throws a 79-83 mph slider with sweeping action, but with some depth. He can toss in a slower curveball in the low 70s, but it??s definitely a fourth pitch. Command has been an issue at times for Palmer and he has more experience out of the pen than in a rotation, leading many scouts to want to make him a reliever at the next level. If teams saw enough of his very strong opening to 2020 (1.30 ERA, 41/5 K/BB ratio in four starts) to believe he has the chance to start, he could join Baumann and Hays in the top three rounds."
"Ian Seymour",115,"P","Virginia Tech","4YR JR","Madison","CT","USA","L","L","Virginia Tech hasn??t had a player taken in the top five rounds since the Cubs took Mark Zagunis in the third round back in 2014, and there hasn't been a Hokies pitcher taken that early since Joe Saunders was a Rays first-round pick in 2002. Seymour, a lefty who was off to a very strong start to his third year in the Virginia Tech rotation before things got shut down, has a good chance to beat both of those records. Seymour isn??t the biggest guy in the world at six-feet, but his stuff took a nice step forward at the start of the spring. After throwing mostly in the 88-90 mph range during a successful stint in the Cape Cod League last summer, the southpaw came out throwing his fastball in the 90-94 range and sitting 92-93 mph consistently. Hitters could not square the pitch up thanks to Seymour??s deception and very heavy life to the pitch. His best secondary pitch is his above-average changeup, an offspeed offering that serves as his strikeout pitch. His breaking ball is fringy at best, a hard slider that tends to get too slurvy. The shortened season didn??t allow scouts to see if Seymour??s fastball gains were for real, but that plus his success on the Cape have some reminded of a lefty like Zac Lowther with a bit more velocity. Teams that are in will give him the chance to start, with the chance of him becoming a fastball-changeup lefty reliever a possibility."
"Andrew Abbott",116,"P","Virginia","4YR JR","Halifax","VA","USA","L","L","Once upon a time, college relievers were highly valued early in the Draft, with bullpen-only arms going in the first round as recently as 2016 (Zack Burdi). Abbott has a very strong track record of success at the University of Virginia, in the Cape Cod League in 2018 and for Team USA this past summer, putting him in position to be one of the first college relievers to come off the board in June. Abbott largely succeeds with a two-pitch repertoire that he can use over multiple innings. He throws his fastball in the 91-95 mph range with good life and command of the pitch. His bread and butter is his breaking ball, a true strikeout pitch that some call a curve but others think of as a slider because of its power and sideways break. It has excellent depth and the tight spin breaks late into the strike zone. He throws it from the same slot as his fastball, making it even more effective. There was some talk of moving Abbott into the rotation as a junior, and he does have a seldom-used changeup he could fold in, though he was back in the pen at the start of the season. Even as a reliever, he still has the chance to go in the first few rounds as a quick to the big leagues future setup man or even closer."
"Casey Schmitt",117,"3B","San Diego State","4YR JR","San Diego","CA","USA","R","R","Two-way players have been a hot trend at the Major League level, with the Angels' Shohei Ohtani leading the way, followed by Rays prospect Brendan McKay. Then there are lesser-known players, like the Angels' Jared Walsh, who have gotten the opportunity to both pitch and hit at the higher levels. Schmitt is the top two-way guy in the college ranks for the Class of 2020, who could fit a Walsh-like profile as a power-hitting corner infielder/relief pitcher. Schmitt has served as San Diego State's closer over his first two seasons, racking up 17 saves with a fastball-splitter combination. He has a clean and easy delivery and consistently gets his fastball up to 94 mph, while keeping it fairly true. He'll throw the splitter 77-80 mph, and he has shown the ability to miss bats with it, something he did well while pitching in the Cape Cod League. His raw power, his best offensive tool, also showed up on the Cape as he homered five times with a wood bat, equaling his total during his sophomore year with the Aztecs. He's a solid defender at third with that plus arm enabling him to make every throw from the hot corner. There is a bit of a split in the scouting industry over liking Schmitt as a hitter or a pitcher. Some see more upside as a power-hitting third baseman, while others think he could move quickly as a reliever only, providing some intrigue over his future as the Draft approached."
"Hayden Cantrelle",118,"SS","University of Louisiana at Lafayette","4YR JR","Lafayette","LA","USA","S","R","Cantrelle was a two-sport star at Teurlings Catholic High (Lafayette, La.), drawing college football interest as a quarterback and leading the Rebels to Louisiana state 4-A baseball championships as a junior and senior. A 40th-round pick by the Yankees in 2017, he became an immediate starter at Louisiana-Lafayette. One of just six NCAA Division I players to total as many as 25 extra-base hits and 25 steals in 2019, he hurt his Draft stock by batting .148 during the four-week college season this spring. A switch-hitter, Cantrelle hits the ball with more authority from the left side of the plate. He has the potential to bat near the top of the batting order with his knack for drawing walks and getting on base, and he also has plus speed and knows how to use it. He has some sneaky pop with 15-homer upside, though he needs to focus less on power and more on making consistent contact. With his quickness and solid arm strength, Cantrelle is capable of playing shortstop at an average big league standard. Teams wanting better defense may prefer him at second base, where he looked good during Cape Cod League play last summer. If he doesn't make enough offensive impact to hold down a regular job, his athleticism and versatility would lend themselves to a utility role."
"Justin Fall",119,"P","Arizona State","4YR JR","Toms River","NJ","USA","L","L","Fall was initially slated to head to St. John??s after his high school career in New Jersey, but instead switched to Brookdale Community College in the Garden State. His sophomore year there last year put him on the Draft map, and the Royals took him in the 34th round of the 2019 Draft. Rather than signing, Fall headed across the country to Arizona State and was serving as the Sun Devils?? Sunday starter over the first part of the season. The 6-foot-6 lefty checks off a lot of boxes. He can play catch at 90-92 mph with an effortless delivery. When he reaches back, he can touch 95-96 mph, though he doesn??t get there consistently at this point. He has plus life on his fastball, with arm side run that generates swings and misses. His secondary stuff is more serviceable than standout, with a slider and changeup that could be average offerings. Fall??s command can come and go, sometimes getting into a groove, sometimes losing feel. In the early going in 2020, he??d often scuffle in the first inning, breeze through the next couple, struggle in the fourth, then be strong in the fifth, but have to come out because of a high pitch count. The stuff is there for him to start, but he??ll have to go out and prove he can do it more consistently once he enters pro ball."
"R.J. Dabovich",120,"P","Arizona State","4YR JR","Pueblo","CO","USA","R","R","Dabovich might have been a decent Draft prospect coming out of the Colorado high school ranks in 2017, but a knee injury during his senior year at Pueblo West High School knocked him off the radar. Initially headed to Wichita State, Dabovich went the junior college route and enrolled at Central Arizona when the Shockers' pitching coach left the program. The right-hander transferred to Arizona State and worked both as a starter and reliever in his first season with the Sun Devils, finishing things off with a solid performance in the Cape Cod League last summer. The 6-foot-3 hurler has largely lived off two pitches which flash plus. He has plenty of arm strength and can run his fastball up to 97 mph, sitting comfortably in the 93-94 mph range, and he's working on adding more life to it. His breaking ball has hard, three-quarters tilt to it and he'll throw it typically in the low-80s. He will work in a curve on rare occasions and he has a changeup that he wants to try to incorporate more. Pitching solely out of the bullpen before his junior season was shut down, he was proving to be very tough to hit, but also struggled with his command. His fastball-breaking ball combination does tick up in shorter stints and he has the chance to be a very effective big league reliever."
"Bryce Bonnin",121,"P","Texas Tech","4YR SO","Webster","TX","USA","R","R","Scouts were split as to whether Bonnin has a brighter future as a pitcher or shortstop until his senior year of high school in 2017, when he blossomed into a top-three-rounds talent on the mound. Signability concerns dropped him to the 26th round and the Cubs, after which he reached the College World Series with two different schools in two years. He transferred from Arkansas after 2018 because the Razorbacks saw him solely as a reliever, and though he won Texas Tech's super-regional clincher and his lone CWS start last June, he has been inconsistent in the rotation.  Bonnin has a pair of legitimate plus pitches in his fastball and slider, which derive tremendous life from his crossfire delivery. His heater sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 97 with riding action, while his slider parks in the mid-80s and knifes across the plate. He also has a hard curveball and a changeup, both of which can be average offerings. Bonnin's quality athleticism should help him in his quest to be a starter, but he throws across his body and with effort. He has trouble keeping his mechanics in sync, resulting in below-average control and command. His live arm remains attractive to pro teams, however, even if it's looking increasingly likely that he'll wind up in the bullpen."
"Liam Norris",122,"P","Green Hope HS","HS SR","Chapel Hill","NC","USA","L","L","Two years after producing a first-round outfielder in Jordyn Adams, Green Hope High (Cary, N.C.) has another early-round prospect in Norris. While Adams didn't break out until the National High School Invitational during his senior year, Norris has been famous on the showcase circuit for a while. He has the pitches and physicality to go in the first round but won't because he hasn't been able to harness them. Norris' powerful 6-foot-4 frame already produces fastballs that sit at 90-94 mph and peak at 96 with some late life. When he's on, both his upper-70s curveball and low-80s slider grade as at least plus offerings. He's in the early stages of developing a changeup with some sink. More strong than athletic, Norris has difficulty keeping his delivery in sync and staying online to the plate. He has 107 walks in 141 career innings at Green Hope and his command is shakier than his control. He might not go high enough in the Draft to divert him from a North Carolina commitment and his long-term role could be as a reliever."
"Carson Seymour",123,"P","Kansas State","4YR JR","Poway","CA","USA","R","R","Kansas State has produced just one top-100 pick in Draft history, second-rounder Jack Woolsey back in 1969, but Seymour has the upside to become the second. His wildness limited him to 7 1/3 innings as a Dartmouth freshman in 2018, but he won pitcher of the year honors in the Hamptons League that summer and joined the Wildcats. Transfer rules dictated he sit out the 2019 season, though he intrigued scouts by reaching 96 mph in the Cape Cod League and touching 99 during fall practice. Seymour's physical 6-foot-5 frame produces fastballs that sit at 92-95 when he starts and park at 95-97 in shorter stints, and he uses his size to create downhill plane. He showed the ability to spin a downer curveball on the Cape, though it regressed when he added a mid-80s slider during the fall. His changeup is still a work in progress. While there's some effort in Seymour's delivery, he repeats his simple mechanics fairly well, so he should be able to provide more consistent strikes than he has. If the redshirt sophomore can improve his ability to locate his pitches, he could profile as a starter. He didn't make any progress and his stuff dropped off after a couple of innings during the brief 2020 season, so he may wind up as a reliever."
"Ryan Webb",124,"P","Georgia","4YR JR","Roswell","GA","USA","L","L","Webb stole the show from Georgia ace and projected top-five-overall pick Emerson Hancock on the first day of the college season, relieving him with 11 strikeouts in five scoreless innings. He won't go in the first round like Hancock or fellow Bulldog Cole Wilcox, but he's Georgia's best southpaw prospect since Alex Wood was a second-rounder in 2012. A team that believes he can transition to starting could take him as early as the third round. Webb's best weapons are his breaking pitches, an upper-70s curveball with depth that ties up both left-handers and right-handers when he locates it, and a low-80s slider that he added this year. He usually operates with a 91-93 mph fastball that reaches 95 and did a better job of holding his velocity for multiple innings during the truncated 2020 season. He also shows some feel for a changeup that could become at least a solid offering if he used it more often. Though he has more than enough pitches to start, Webb has been a full-time reliever since the end of his freshman season. He's still refining his control and command, and he needs to do a better job of locating his fastball because he can't just blow it by hitters. He has an upright delivery and missed six weeks in 2019 with a sore arm, so scouts aren't totally sold that he can handle a starter's workload."
"Luke Waddell",125,"SS","Georgia Tech","4YR JR","Loveland","OH","USA","L","R","A 32nd-round pick as a sophomore a year ago, Waddell turned down the D-backs and spent the summer as the first Georgia Tech player on the U.S. collegiate national team since Derek Dietrich in 2008. The primary leadoff hitter on Team USA, he has the attributes to serve in that role in pro ball as well. He has one of the best floors among college infielders, with a high likelihood of serving at least a utility role and a chance to become a regular. Waddell focuses on making contact with a measured left-handed swing. That approach doesn't yield much in the way of power, but he repeatedly produces line drives to all fields and enhances his on-base ability by controlling the count. A plus runner who was a star running back at Loveland (Ohio) High, he has the quickness and know-how to steal bases. After dividing his time between three infield positions as a freshman, Waddell took over as the Yellow Jackets' shortstop early in his sophomore season. An average defender with solid arm strength at shortstop, he profiles as a better defender at second base. He's also capable of playing third base but doesn't fit the offensive profile there."
"Trei Cruz",126,"SS","Rice","4YR SO","Toronto","ON","Canada","S","R","Cruz may have the most extensive big league pedigree in this year's Draft, as his father Jose, grandfather Jose and great-uncles Hector and Tommy all played in the Majors. His uncle Enrique started at second base for the 2003 College World Series champions at Rice, where Trei has spent the last three seasons. Selected in the 35th round out of high school by the Astros in 2017 and in the 37th round as a sophomore-eligible by the Nationals in 2019, he should fit in the first five rounds after improving several aspects of his game. A switch-hitter, Cruz has toned down his approach after selling out for home runs in the past. He has modified a big leg kick he used from the left side of the plate and displayed better strike-zone discipline during the truncated 2020 season. Scouts see him as a hit-over-power guy who could provide 15 homers on an annual basis. Cruz posted below-average running times in the past but now flashes average speed, especially once he gets going, and shows aggressiveness and savvy on the bases. His average arm and fringy range don't lend themselves to sticking at shortstop, though he may get a chance to play there for a while in pro ball after displaying more quickness this spring. His best fit is at second base, where he played well as a freshman."
"Tyler Keenan",127,"3B","Ole Miss","4YR JR","Clayton","NC","USA","L","R","Keenan went off in Mississippi's shortened 17-game schedule, homering seven times and ranking second in NCAA Division I with 33 RBIs. One of the better lefty sluggers in the college crop, he topped the Rebels with 15 homers last season and finished second at the College Home Run Derby.  The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Keenan is all about power, using his strength and bat speed to launch balls with topspin. There's some concern as to how well his uppercut swing will play against pro pitching, but he manages the strike zone well and uses the entire field. He makes consistent contact, getting to his pop while producing high exit velocities. A well-below-average runner, Keenan offers no value on the bases and doesn't cover much ground at third base. He has reliable hands and solid arm strength, as well as determination to stay at the hot corner, but his lack of range and ability to make throws on the run likely will land him at first base in pro ball. Former Rebel Thomas Dillard had a similar offensive profile and more athleticism when the Brewers selected him in the fifth round last year, and Keenan should go in roughly the same area."
"Trenton Denholm",128,"P","University of California - Irvine","4YR JR","San Jose","CA","USA","R","R","UC Irvine has produced a fair amount of Draft talent over the years, led by 2017 first-round pick Keston Hiura. Denholm, a smaller pitchability right-hander who began the year as the Anteaters?? ace, won??t do as well as the Brewers?? second baseman, but has the chance to land somewhere in the top four or five rounds. Denholm has a reputation for being one of the best college strike-throwers in the country. He doesn??t have huge stuff, but he can command all three pitches well and never gives in to hitters. He??ll throw his fastball in the 90-93 mph range and he backs it up with a plus changeup, his best offering that keeps hitters off-balance. His 75-77 mph curveball is improving and he started tinkering with a slider. Not only does Denholm throw strikes at will with all three, he??s done it against good competition, posting a 0.00 ERA in 28 2/3 Cape Cod League innings over two summers. He had taken over as Irvine??s Friday night starter from Andre Pallante, who was a fourth-round pick in 2019, and has the chance to go in the same neck of the woods come Draft time."
"Jackson Leath",129,"P","Tennessee","4YR JR","Waxahachie","TX","USA","R","R","Leath showcased one of the better arms in the Texas junior college ranks last spring at Blinn, but his commitment to Tennessee left him undrafted. The Volunteers used him as a starter and long reliever this year, and he won all four of his extended outings while striking out 29 in 18 2/3 innings. Though his future role has yet to be determined, he should fit in the first three to five rounds of the Draft. During the shortened 2020 season, Leath showed the ability to maintain a 92-95 mph fastball with sink for four or five innings at a time, topping out at 97. He also misses bats with a mid-80s slider/cutter that's effective against both left-handers and right-handers. He rounds out his repertoire with a hard curveball and a changeup that shows the potential to become an average offering. Leath isn't especially tall but he's strong and physical, which bodes well for his durability. He has no problems throwing strikes, so he can project as a four-pitch starter or as a multi-inning reliever who focuses on his fastball and slider. The team that drafts him likely will give him the opportunity to develop in the rotation."
"Trevor Hauver",130,"CF","Arizona State","4YR JR","Chandler","AZ","USA","L","R","Arizona State was an easy stop on the early scouting trail in 2020. Not only could many teams?? scouts check in with parent clubs during Spring Training, but there were many Sun Devils worth checking out. At the top of that list, of course, is Spencer Torkelson, but after a slow start, Hauver was starting to show his bat deserved plenty of attention on its own. After scuffling a bit as a freshman, Hauver began to show what he??s capable of doing as a sophomore, hitting .339/.433/.574, largely as the Sun Devils?? leadoff hitter. A move to the three-hole behind Torkelson messed him up initially, but he was starting to heat up and show once again he can drive the ball and he can draw walks from the left side of the plate. He has the chance to hit for both average and power at the next level with a solid overall approach. His bat is going to have to play because it??s a bit unclear where he plays defensively. A shortstop in high school, Hauver played left field at ASU because there were better options on the dirt on the roster. He believes he can play the infield, and if that??s the case, second base would be the best bet given his limited range. Some see a Daniel Murphy type in the future, one who maybe plays second, left, even some first base, with his bat carrying him up the ladder."
"Yohandy Morales",131,"SS","Braddock HS","HS SR","Miami","FL","USA","R","R","Back in 2001, the Yankees signed Cuban defector Andy Morales to a four-year deal, only to cut ties with the infielder, reportedly because he had lied about his age. Nearly two decades later, his son Yohandy has the chance to enter pro ball as one of the top high school infielders from Florida with some offensive upside. Big and physical, Morales has the chance to hit, and with power, in the future. He has a knack for barreling up the baseball, though he can be too much of a guess hitter and there are a lot of moving parts to his swing. That said, there is a lot of raw pop for the right-handed hitter to tap into if he can smooth some things out mechanically and refine his overall approach. Fairly physically mature, Morales played shortstop in high school, but nearly everyone sees a move to his father??s old position at the hot corner. He does have a strong arm, and continued work on his footwork and hands should make him more than capable at third. Teams who think his bat will profile well at the infield corner will take the chance at signing him away from his University of Miami commitment."
"Coby Mayo",132,"3B","Stoneman Douglas HS","HS SR","Margate","FL","USA","R","R","Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida has produced some serious talent over the years, starting with Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and continuing with A??s left-hander Jesus Luzardo and Rockies third-base prospect Colton Welker. Mayo also plays the hot corner, with the kind of power potential that many teams covet. There are no questions about Mayo??s raw power from the right side of the plate. He can flat-out crush the ball, using his strong 6-foot-5 frame to his advantage. The concerns crop up regarding whether he??ll hit enough to get to that power on a consistent basis. There??s swing and miss to his game and while he??ll show the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field in batting practice, he can get very pull-happy in games. Not everyone is convinced Mayo can stick at third as well. While he does have a well above-average arm, his feet and hands are just OK, which might mean a move to first base or maybe to left field. His strong arm, power and physicality might remind some of Austin Riley and the team that tries to sign him away from his commitment to Florida will believe that??s who he can become."
"Tyler Brown",133,"P","Vanderbilt","4YR JR","Mansfield","OH","USA","R","R","Brown already has overcome more adversity than most players will face, losing his mother to cancer when he was 13, blowing out his elbow and having Tommy John surgery as a high school sophomore, and fathering a daughter born with Down syndrome and life-threatening heart defects when he was a Vanderbilt freshman. His toughness translates to the mound, where he set a school record with 17 saves in 2019, including three in Omaha as the Commodores won their second national championship. He wasn't as sharp in the shortened 2020 season but still should be one of the first relievers drafted. Brown usually attacks hitters with a 91-94 mph fastball with running action that misses bats up in the strike zone, topping out at 96, and an 83-86 mph slider. Both pitches were more solid than plus this spring but have shown better in the past. He also mixes in a mid-70s curveball with more depth than power to give batters a different look, and he can throw them off balance with a decent low-80s changeup. As with his stuff, Brown's control and command were a tick down this year but he usually pounds the zone. With his four pitches, strike-throwing ability and a strong 6-foot-4 build, some scouts think he has the ingredients to start and could get the opportunity to do so in pro ball. Other evaluators believe his delivery and mentality are better suited for late-inning relief."
"Holden Powell",134,"P","UCLA","4YR JR","Visalia","CA","USA","R","R","As a freshman, Powell took over as UCLA??s closer and held on to the job until the 2020 season was ended prematurely. He racked up 26 saves, second in school history behind only David Berg, and was quickly becoming one of the best relief pitching options in the Draft class this spring, with a 20/2 K/BB ratio while allowing just three hits and no runs over 9 1/3 innings in eight appearances. Powell isn??t one of those college relievers you wonder about whether he could start at the next level. The nation??s Stopper of the Year as a sophomore, the 6-foot right-hander is bullpen only, but the type who could move quickly. He typically sits in the low 90s with his fastball and is regularly up to 96 mph. It??s his slider, though, that??s the real separator. It??s a filthy out pitch that gets a ton of swings and misses, a plus pitch for sure. Powell does have a changeup, but it??s that electric fastball-slider combination that has peaked scouts?? interest. With a loud delivery, he??s had trouble with command, but was finding the strike zone more consistently this spring and throws enough strikes to profile well in the back of a bullpen, a role he relishes, with the makeup to close games at the next level."
"Hunter Barnhart",135,"P","St. Joseph HS","HS SR","Paso Robles","CA","USA","R","R","Finding multisport athletes who want to play baseball at the next level has long been a challenge for scouts. This year??s Draft offers several players who showed their ability on the gridiron as quarterbacks as well as the baseball field, starting with top 100 players like Cade Horton in Oklahoma and Nolan McLean in North Carolina. Barnhart, who was the MVP of his league as St. Joseph??s QB, had his name jumping up Draft boards and moving closer to those two thanks to a quick start this spring. There were two things that jumped out in Barnhart??s performances this spring that gave him some helium. The first was more velocity with his fastball, up to 96 mph at times. The other was his curve, a true plus breaking ball thrown 77-80 mph that he can really spin. His changeup is behind the other two and he hasn??t thrown it much, but he throws the 81-84 mph offspeed pitch with good arm speed and it has the chance to develop into an average offering in the future. Though his inexperience as a pitcher shows at times in terms of his approach and mechanics, Barnhart throws a lot of strikes and it??s easy to believe that the big, strong, athletic right-hander will have solid command in the future. There was an up arrow next to his name when things shut down and thought of him being committed to pitching only could have teams willing to take the Arizona State commit in the top five rounds."
"Alec Burleson",136,"1B","East Carolina","4YR JR","Charlotte","NC","USA","L","L","East Carolina produced a pair of top-five-round picks for the first time ever in 2019, with left-hander Jake Agnos going in the fourth round to the Yankees and outfielder Bryant Packard in the fifth to the Tigers. It should happen again in 2020 with righty Gavin Williams and Burleson. Though Burleson is one of the top two-way performers in college baseball and pulled double duty for the U.S. collegiate national team last summer, clubs consider him a much better prospect as a hitter than as a pitcher. Burleson has a pretty left-handed swing and seems to make line-drive contact almost at will. Most of his pop has gone to the gaps rather than over the fence in college, leading to questions about his home run ceiling. Some evaluators see him as a hit-over-power guy who will max out at 15 homers, while others envision his strength, bat speed and solid raw pop translating into 20 or more on an annual basis. Though Burleson is a better athlete than he gets credit for, he still lacks speed and range and will need to hit for power to become a big league regular. He shows good hands and plays solid defense at first base but doesn't cover enough ground to man the outfield corners in pro ball after seeing time there with the Pirates. On the mound, he's a finesse lefty who backs up an 87-90 mph fastball with an effective slider and changeup."
"Chase Hampton",137,"P","Kilgore HS","HS SR","Kilgore","TX","USA","R","R","The second tier of Texas high school pitchers includes several Texas Tech recruits, with Hampton ranking as the best of a group that also includes right-handers Marco Raya (United South High, Laredo) and Levi Wells (LaPorte High). As a junior, Hampton led Kilgore to the state 4-A semifinals. He showed improved stuff this spring and looked like a third- or fourth-rounder on his best days. Hampton can show a 91-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95 with four-seam, riding action, and there also are games when he works more at 88-91. His curveball similarly fluctuates in quality, ranging from a near-plus offering with depth to a looser version. His changeup displays some fade and should improve as he uses it more often.  Hampton's arm works fine and he has cleaned up his three-quarters delivery some since last summer, so he should throw enough strikes to start. Like many high school pitchers, his control is more advanced than his command and he'll have to learn to locate his pitches better at the next level. If he doesn't turn pro, scouts believe he can contribute immediately at Texas Tech."
"Nick Griffin",138,"P","Monticello Sr HS","HS SR","Monticello","AR","USA","L","L","Two Arkansas high school pitchers thrust themselves into top-five-rounds consideration at the Future Stars Series at Fenway Park last September. Watson Chapel (Pine Bluff) right-hander Markevian Hence will go earlier in the Draft because he has more present stuff and he's more signable, though Griffin has the advantages of being left-handed and more projectable. Both Arkansas recruits won??t turn 18 until after they graduate this spring, making them more appealing to clubs that put more emphasis on age. Griffin has added 20 pounds of muscle since last summer and still has more room to add strength to his lanky 6-foot-4 frame. He already works at 89-92 mph and tops out at 94 with his fastball, and he should pick up more velocity as he matures physically. He shows some feel for spinning a curveball with good depth, and he also can get some swings and misses with his slider. Griffin's arm action is a bit long but he's making strides with his relatively easy delivery. He should develop better feel for a changeup when he uses it more at the next level and his athleticism should translate into at least average control and command. He also shows some promise as a hitter and could fit the right-field profile, though teams clearly prefer him on the mound."
"Nick Yorke",139,"SS","Archbishop Mitty HS","HS SR","Newport Beach","CA","USA","R","R","Archbishop Mitty High School in San Jose, Calif., has produced three big leaguers in the history of the Draft: Outfielders Mike Vail, who first came up with the Mets in 1975, and Mitch Haniger, who went on to Cal Poly before being drafted by the Brewers in 2012, as well as right-hander Trevor Hildenberger, who wasn??t drafted out of high school, but was drafted out of Cal in 2014. Yorke isn??t projected to go as early as Haniger did after his college career (No. 38 overall), but it??s a strong possibility his bat gets him off the board way earlier than either Vail (17th round of June 1970 Draft) or Haniger (31st round, 2009). Scouts believe Yorke has a real chance to swing the bat, with perhaps even plus hit potential from the right side of the plate. He??s a natural hitter with a pure swing and an advanced approach at the plate and there??s enough power potential in there to believe he could eventually be a run-producing type of player.  The questions about Yorke pop up concerning his future defensive home. He??s played shortstop in high school, and might have the range, hands and instincts to stay there, but he had shoulder surgery and has anchors in his shoulder causing him to DH for all of his junior year in 2019. He was back on the dirt this spring, but what had been solid average arm strength had not yet returned. Still, he could profile very well as an offensive-minded second baseman with a bat that could be worth luring away from his commitment to the University of Arizona."

He also played for Team USA??s 18-and-under team in international competition for two years, so he??s extremely well known by the scouting industry. There isn??t much projection left with the undersized right-hander, but there??s a lot of now stuff to like about Rajcic. He has the chance to have three average to above-average offerings in the future. His fastball sits 92-93 mph consistently, thrown with a lot of sink and commanded well, and he maintains his velocity deep into starts. He backs it up with a high-spin breaking ball, a slider that flashes plus. His changeup is a touch behind, but he shows enough feel for it to easily see an at least average offspeed offering. Rajcic has always thrown a lot of strikes and as a guy who hit in the middle of OLU??s lineup, his athleticism plays very well on the mound. He clearly loves the big stage and is super competitive, something teams will certainly take into account when deciding if they want to try to sign him away from his commitment to UCLA."
"Ty Floyd",141,"P","Rockmart HS","HS SR","Rome","GA","USA","R","R","The top pitcher in Louisiana State's recruiting class, Floyd is one of the more athletic pitchers in the 2020 Draft but is also very much a work in progress. Scouts thought he had a chance to go in the first two rounds entering the year, though continued inconsistency during the brief high school season may make it difficult to take him high enough to divert him from Baton Rouge. Floyd has a quick arm that generates 90-95 mph fastballs, getting swings and misses up in the strike zone with riding action. He'll show glimpses of a solid curveball but it's not reliable yet, often degenerating into more of a slurve. He hasn't had much need for a changeup to this point, so it lags behind his other offerings. Floyd's delivery features some effort and recoil that detract from his fastball command. In order to pay him enough to lure him away from LSU, a club will have to bank that his athleticism will allow him to clean up his mechanics and polish his repertoire. It's quite possible that he winds up attending college and develops into one of the top arms in the 2023 Draft."
"Jesse Franklin",142,"CF","Michigan","4YR JR","Seattle","WA","USA","L","L","Washington's top high school prospect in 2017, Franklin dropped to the Mariners in the 37th round because of his steadfast commitment to Michigan. He starred as a freshman and while his numbers declined as a sophomore as he got more power-happy, he helped the Wolverines to a shocking second-place finish at the 2019 College World Series. Scouts were curious as to which version would show up in 2020, but he broke his collarbone in a skiing accident and never took the field before the shortened season ended. Franklin's strength gives him solid to plus raw power and he's at his best when he lets it come naturally. He did a better job of that in 2018 compared to last year, when he improved at controlling the strike zone but didn't make as much quality contact while his left-handed stroke got more uphill. He has hit for average but with only modest power in the wood-bat Cape Cod League, so his offensive projection remains a bit of a puzzle. Franklin also possesses solid speed but doesn't always play that fast. He hasn't shown much basestealing prowess and displays shaky reads and routes at times in center field. He has fringy arm strength, so if he can't stay up the middle he'll have to play left field."
"Timmy Manning",143,"P","Cardinal Gibbons HS","HS SR","Coral Springs","FL","USA","L","L","There are high school arms who are all about arm strength, velocity and ceiling. Then there are those who present themselves more like college arms, who really know how to pitch but might not currently have wow, jump-off-the-page kind of stuff. Manning fits into the latter category as a left-hander who showed an ability to mix pitches and keep hitters off-balance over the summer, particularly during his time at Major League Baseball's PDP League. Manning has the chance to have a very good three-pitch mix at his disposal. His best pitch is his curveball, thrown with excellent spin, depth and finish. He typically throws it in the mid-70s and he commands it better than his fastball, with a chance for it to be a true out pitch for the left-hander. His fastball is fringe-to-average, and he runs it up to 91 mph. Manning can spot it fairly well and he does have the chance to add some strength and perhaps a few ticks to it in the future. He has good feel for his changeup, and it could be a second plus pitch in time, but he goes to his curve to get right-handed hitters out currently. Manning typically has a delivery that works very well, allowing him to find the strike zone consistently. Any teams interested in obtaining his feel for pitching, even without any velocity gains this spring, will have to contend with his commitment to the University of Florida."
"Tekoah Roby",144,"P","Pine Forest HS","HS SR","Asheville","NC","USA","R","R","Florida is a hotbed for Draft talent every year, but the Panhandle hasn??t always been as accessible. Roby had impressed some scouts over the summer and backed it up at the start of the spring, though the early end of the season kept him from being as seen as much as he would??ve been under normal circumstances, when scouts would??ve headed to Pensacola as word of Roby??s stuff spread. Roby has the makings of a very solid three-pitch mix, coming from a solid frame, loose delivery, long arms and loose wrist action that allows for good movement on his pitches. He??ll throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range, with excellent sinking life. He complements it with a 74-78 mph downer-breaking curveball, a pitch that??s at least above-average in the future. He does have a changeup, but he needs to work on developing it to catch it up with his fastball-curve combination. The right-hander who is committed to Troy University tends to be around the strike zone, but needs to improve his overall control and command. While he??s not the biggest guy in the world, there is some projection here, with teams considering him in the top few rounds seeing a potential No. 4 type starter in the future."
"Jack Leftwich",145,"P","Florida","4YR SO","Cedar Rapids","IA","USA","R","R","Leftwich moved from his high school to focus on baseball at TNXL Academy while finishing his academics online. While the Tigers took him in the 39th round of the 2017 Draft, everyone knew he was headed to join the University of Florida pitching staff. He's been a part of it for two years, being a weekend starter with Tommy Mace as a sophomore and then pitching well in the Cape Cod League. The big and strong right-hander is still more thrower than pitcher, with a power repertoire that does give him the chance to start. He has better pure stuff than Mace, with an explosive fastball that hits 96 mph regularly and sits around 94 mph consistently. He throws his low-80s slider with late break and depth, a real hard, downer power slider. He throws his changeup with about the same velocity as his slider and he throws it with good arm speed. While Leftwich is generally around the strike zone, often attacking up in the zone, he doesn't command the ball well within it consistently. He'll get every chance to start given his repertoire and his ability to maintain velocity deep into starts, traits that should get him a lot of looks as the Draft approaches."
"Kale Emshoff",146,"C","University of Arkansas - Little Rock","4YR SR","Robstown","TX","USA","R","R","Emshoff hit .253 with four homers in his first two seasons at Arkansas-Little Rock before blowing out his elbow during the Trojans' scout day in the fall of 2018. After missing all of 2019 following Tommy John surgery, he returned to bat .417 and homer seven times in 17 games this spring, going deep in five of his last seven contests before the season ended. The redshirt junior has a chance to become the highest pick in school history, surpassing 2003 fourth-rounder Rick Guarno. Emshoff first hinted at his power by winning the MINK League home run derby after his freshman season. The strength and leverage in his 6-foot-2, 228-pound frame gives him plus raw pop that he's tapping into more often as he improves his plate discipline. He could provide enough offense to possibly profile at an infield corner if he doesn't stick behind the plate. With his fringy to average receiving skills, Emshoff should be able to remain at catcher. He hasn't bounced all the way back from elbow reconstruction but has displayed solid arm strength in the past. He's a bottom-of-the-scale runner but moves well enough behind the dish and has aptitude for blocking balls."
"Shane Drohan",147,"P","Florida State","4YR JR","Fort Lauderdale","FL","USA","L","L","Back in 2017, Drohan was a high school lefty in Florida with some upside and some helium. A top 100 prospect on MLB Pipeline??s Draft list, the son of former Minor League right-hander Bill Drohan was a two-sport standout who ended up going to Florida State rather than sign with the Phillies, who took him in the 23rd round of the Draft that June. After spending most of his sophomore year as a starter, he was establishing himself as a mainstay in the Seminoles?? weekend rotation this spring. A successful high school quarterback before turning his complete focus to baseball, Drohan is still learning how to pitch, meaning there??s still ceiling to reach. He??ll touch 95 mph with his fastball at times and sits 92-93 consistently. He hides the ball well and that deception leads to a lot of swings and misses on the pitch. He has the chance to have an above-average curveball, with good three-quarter break to it and his changeup continues to improve. Drohan??s command comes and goes, but because of his athleticsm, there??s confidence from many scouts that he??ll be able to repeat his delivery and throw more consistent strikes. There??s still a lot to dream on here, giving the southpaw more upside than the typical college pitcher."
"Colby Halter",148,"SS","Bishop Kenny HS","HS SR","Jacksonville","FL","USA","L","R","To date, the best hitter to come out of Bishop Kenney High School in Jacksonville, Fla., has been Ben Gamel, a 10th-round pick in 2010 now with the Brewers, though Kevin Witt was a first-rounder taken by the Blue Jays back in 1994. Halter likely won??t go as early as Witt did, but after a summer that saw him hit .333 in PDP League play and then .419 for Team USA in international competition, his bat was certainly on people??s radars, though he did get off to a slower start this spring. Halter is more of the type who gets called a real ???baseball player?? rather than having any eye-popping tools. His ability to hit does stand out more than anything else and the left-handed hitter showed an ability over the summer to make consistent hard contact against good competition. He??s more extra-base authority than home run pop right now, but the knack for barreling up the ball is hard to ignore. A shortstop in high school, most feel Halter will have to move positions. He played all over the infield for Team USA and because he might not have the power to profile at third, his best chance at being an every day player at one spot might be second. He reminds some in the area of Tyler Callihan, who got an over-slot bonus from the Reds to sign last year. The same might need to happen to keep Halter from heading to the University of Florida."
"Sammy Infante",149,"SS","Monsignor Edward Pace HS","HS SR","Hialeah","FL","USA","R","R","Monsignor Edward Pace High School in Miami has produced a ton of professional talent, more notably on the mound with big leaguers like Gio Gonzalez and Alex Fernandez. The most recent high Draft pick was shortstop Jeter Downs, taken 32nd overall by the Reds and now a highly regarded prospect in the Red Sox's system. Infante, who stood out at events like the East Coast Pro Showcase last summer, hopes to follow in Downs?? footsteps as a middle infielder from the school to the pro game, though he isn??t expected to go quite as early. Infante has shown glimpses of being able to do a lot of different things well on the baseball field, even if he doesn??t have a true wow tool. Over the summer, he showed an ability to make hard contact and drive the ball. There have been contact issues in the past, but he was making adjustments and there??s some raw power to tap into there. Infante is an average runner, and the jury is still out as to whether he can stay at shortstop. Those who believe he can point to his strong arm and decent actions. Others feel he lacks the quickness to stay there and might be better suited at second or third, where there would be more pressure on the power to show up. And there are some who see a future Maikel Franco type of player. A team that believes his tools will translate to the pro game is likely to take him early enough to sign him away from his Miami commitment."
"Tyler McDonough",150,"2B","North Carolina State","4YR SO","Cincinnati","OH","USA","S","R","McDonough caught in high school but found projected 2020 first-rounder Patrick Bailey behind the plate when he got to North Carolina State, so he played center field as a freshman last spring. He split time between center and second base this year, showing the ability to handle both positions while extending his streak of college games without ever making an error to 78. A product of Moeller High (Cincinnati), which has spawned 14 big leaguers and a pair of Hall of Famers in Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Larkin, he's eligible for the 2020 Draft because he's already 21. A switch-hitter, McDonough makes quality contact and controls the strike zone from both sides of the plate. While his on-base skills stand out more than his power, he can drive the ball on occasion and did so more consistently as a sophomore. He has solid speed and the instincts to make the most of it on the bases. McDonough's quickness also translates into range in the field. He takes good routes in center field, where he's a solid defender with arm strength to match, and offers similar upside at second base once he gets more experience there. One scout described him as a grinder in the mold of Adam Eaton."
"Grant Richardson",151,"CF","Indiana","4YR SO","Fishers","IN","USA","L","L","Richardson earned a starting job at Indiana a month into his 2019 freshman season, which was highlighted by a three-homer game against Maryland. He played as well as any sophomore in college baseball this spring, leading the Big Ten Conference with five homers in 14 games while batting .424/.453/.797. Draft-eligible because he'll turn 21 in mid-July, he could sneak into the first five rounds if he's signable. After adding strength last offseason, Richardson is hitting the ball harder and now shows solid raw power from the left side of the plate. He does come with some swing-and-miss concerns because he struck out in 30 percent of his plate appearances in his first two years with the Hoosiers, but there are no red flags with his swing. If he can tone down his aggressive approach, he could do more consistent damage. Richardson ran a 6.54-second 60-yard dash at a Great Lakes League workout last summer, though his speed plays closer to solid on the bases and in center field. He spent most of his freshman season in right field before taking over for Pirates 2019 second-rounder Matt Gorski in center this spring. He has a chance to stay there in pro ball but may fit better on a corner, and he has enough arm strength to handle right field."
"Kevin Abel",152,"P","Oregon State","4YR JR","San Diego","CA","USA","R","R","Abel was a solid high school prospect in the San Diego area back in 2017, one who was much more about pitchability and command than pure stuff. His strong commitment to Oregon State led to him not getting selected until the 35th round that June. Scouts were getting excited at the chance to draft him again in 2020, especially after a strong freshman year that culminated in a huge performance in the College World Series clinching game, but he needed Tommy John surgery as a sophomore, leaving a big question mark next to his name. When healthy, Abel is still very much about his advanced feel for pitching. His fastball was in the 90-93 mph range, sitting 90-91, and he commanded it to both sides of the plate very well. He??s willing to throw his curveball, close to a 12-to-6 breaking ball with deep late action to it, at any point in the count. His changeup is a plus offering as well and he??s long pitched like a veteran in terms of not giving in to hitters and sticking to a gameplan. The hope was that Abel would have returned at some point in 2020, but that hadn??t happened at the time of the shut down. So any team contemplating trying to sign Abel away from staying at Oregon State to prove he??s healthy in 2021 will have to do so based almost entirely on his freshman year in 2018."
"Hugh Fisher",153,"P","Vanderbilt","4YR JR","Germantown","TN","USA","R","L","Fisher exhibited top-five-rounds talent as a Tennessee high schooler in 2017, but his Vanderbilt commitment rendered him unsignable and he went undrafted. He spent his first two college seasons in the bullpen and contributed to the Commodores' 2019 national title, then blew out his elbow and had Tommy John surgery last fall. He might have fit in the top three rounds had he been healthy and pitched well this spring, and while that didn't happen, he has enough track record that he still could get picked early enough to sign him. Fisher had plenty of projection in his 6-foot-5 frame when he arrived in Nashville, and his fastball has gained velocity as he has gotten stronger. He went from working at 88-91 mph as a high school senior to operating at 94-96 in shorter stints as a college sophomore. He also has added some power to his breaking ball, which has become a low-80s slider, but hasn't used his changeup much as a reliever. Employing a low three-quarters arm slot with some crossfire in his delivery, Fisher creates tough angle for left-handers and deception but sometimes has trouble keeping his long limbs in sync. That leads to inconsistencies with his control, which leads more scouts to project him strictly as a reliever. It's possible that the team that selects him will give him a chance to start, which he never got on loaded Vanderbilt pitching staffs."
"Dalton Fowler",154,"P","Northwest Mississippi CC","JC J2","Southaven","MS","USA","L","L","After displaying a low-80s fastball as a Tennessee high school junior in 2017 and a mid-80s heater as a senior, Fowler popped up on scouting radars when he jumped into the low 90s last spring as a Northwest Mississippi CC freshman. Inconsistency left a large gap between his present and his projection, so he wound up dropping to the Mets in the 27th round amid signability concerns. He initially planned to transfer to Mississippi for 2020, but returned to the Rangers to remain Draft-eligible. Fowler led Division II junior college pitchers in strikeout rate (18.5 per nine innings) this spring while usually sitting at 90-91 mph and touching 93 with sink on his fastball. He has some feel for spinning the ball, flashing a mid-70s curveball with good depth but also struggling at times to stay on top of his breaker. He also shows some aptitude with his changeup, giving him a potential three-pitch mix. Though Fowler did a better job of throwing strikes during the shortened 2020 season, his control and command still need a lot of work. He has cleaned up his low three-quarters delivery and is doing a better job of holding his velocity, which dipped as low as 86 mph at times a year ago. He did get crosschecked some despite making only four starts, and he'll head to Oklahoma if he doesn't turn pro this summer."
"T.J. Nichols",155,"P","Oakmont HS","HS SR","Carmichael","CA","USA","R","R","Before last summer, Nichols was a relatively unknown two-way player from the Northern California high school ranks. Then he took the mound at the Area Code Games in August and opened a ton of eyes as an intriguing, albeit raw, right-hander with arm strength who was high on follow lists at the start of the spring. He was a little inconsistent out of the gate before the season ended. Athletic and wiry, Nichols has pitched and played the infield for his high school team and has the chance to continue to do both should he go on to college. He??s more of a thrower than a pitcher right now, but he??s shown the ability to get his fastball up to 96 mph and added strength should help him find velocity more consistently. He couples the fastball with a very effective short slider with good action to it, a breaking ball that could be a plus pitch in time. He??s struggled to find feel for a changeup, so it??s not been much of a factor for him. Because of that lack of a third pitch, as well as some command and delivery issues, there is some reliever risk with Nichols. But there??s also a ton of upside thanks to his athleticism and projectable frame. Originally committed to Sacramento State, he switched to Arizona, where he could play on the left side of the infield and pitch for the Wildcats if the Draft doesn??t work out."
"Jason Savacool",156,"P","Baker HS","HS SR","Syracuse","NY","USA","R","R","Savacool has the chance to be the third right-handed pitcher from Baker High School in the upstate New York town of Baldwinsville to be drafted, following Jason Grilli (a 24th-rounder in 1994, who went on to Seton Hall University, and was a first-round selection in 1997), and Royals 2014 second-rounder Scott Blewett, who reached Triple-A in 2019. Savacool had a strong summer showcase circuit performance and pitched well for USA Baseball??s 18U National Team, leaving scouts excited to see him this spring, something that didn??t happen because of the coronavirus pandemic. While Savacool isn??t the typical tall and projectable high school right-hander, he does have an athletic build and wide shoulders that allow him to have present strength and the potential for more. He also has a free and easy arm action that delivers a potential four-pitch mix and a more advanced feel for pitching that one might expect from a cold-weather prepster. He??ll throw his fastball up to 94 mph, sitting in the 92-93 range consistently. He complements his heater not only with a solid upper-70s slider, but also with a circle change as well as a split-fingered changeup with good action to it. Savacool goes right after hitters with a very good game plan, one that was on display at top events like the PDP League and East Coast Professional Showcase. He wasn??t able to raise his stock anymore this spring, so scouts will have to rely completely on those summer performances to evaluate the Maryland recruit."
"Jake Smith",157,"P","State College of Florida Manatee - Sarasota","JC J2","Chapel Hill","NC","USA","R","R","A standout high school pitcher in North Carolina as the 2018 Draft approached, Smith was initially committed to UNC-Wilmington, but he opted to head to Chipola Junior College rather than go the four-year school route or sign with the Phillies, who had drafted him in the 21st round. He went from there to the State Junior College of Florida and had gotten off to a very good start in the Manatees?? rotation this spring before the season was shut down. The 6-foot-5 right-hander has a big arm that has shown the ability to miss a lot of bats, as Smith struck out better than 13 per nine innings this spring. He does it mostly with a fastball-slider combination that gets on hitters in a hurry. He??s up to 96 mph, touching 97 mph when he was out of the bullpen at Chipola with his fastball. His slider will flash above average, but it??s not as consistent as his heater, and while he does have a changeup, it??s far behind the other two offerings. Deception in his delivery keeps hitters from getting good looks, and Smith was doing a nice job repeating his delivery and throwing strikes over his 40 innings of work this spring. He might best be suited for a relief role, where the fastball-slider combination would play up, but teams might be willing to send him out as a starter and see if he can develop enough of a third pitch to stick in a rotation."
"Grayson Hitt",158,"P","Houston HS","HS SR","Memphis","TN","USA","R","L","Hitt is the best prospect to come out of Houston High (Germantown, Tenn.) since 2002 first-rounder Matt Cain and 2003 second-rounder Stuart Pomeranz, both of whom reached the big leagues. He's also a star wide receiver who caught 54 passes for 1,101 yards and 18 touchdowns as Houston went to the state 6-A semifinals last fall. His projectability stands out more than his present stuff and he didn't get much of a chance to pitch this spring, which makes it more likely that he follows through on his college commitment to Alabama. Hitt can run his fastball up to 93 mph and usually deals at 88-91, and he could sit in the mid-90s once he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. He backs it up with a curveball that features good depth and should become at least a solid offering once he adds more power. He also shows some feel for a changeup that will become more reliable as he uses it more often. With his size and a high three-quarters arm angle, Hitt creates downhill plane on his pitches. The combination of his athleticism and his easy delivery allows him to throw strikes, though he'll need to continue refining his command. If he joins the Crimson Tide, he could blossom into an early-round pick in 2023."
"Jacob Misiorowski",159,"P","Grain Valley HS","HS SR","Blue Springs","MO","USA","R","R","With coronavirus shutting down sports across the country, several projectable high school pitchers never got the chance to show scouts what they could do this spring, making it nearly impossible to invest enough in them to divert them from college. A prime example is Misiorowski, who was hampered by a hamstring injury last summer but looked more impressive during the fall. His senior season got cancelled, though he did show some electric stuff during a preseason bullpen workout. While he's far from a finished product, Misiorowski has the 6-foot-6 build and raw stuff to dream on and think that he has a chance to become another Adam Wainwright. He has a quick arm that produces 90-94 mph fastballs with high spin rates and backspin action, and his frame has plenty of room to add strength and velocity. He has developed an overhand curveball that can be a hammer at its best and has surpassed his slider, which can reach the mid-80s with bite. Misiorowski still is learning to keep his long limbs in sync, so his control and command remain works in progress, as does his changeup. He has made improvements to his delivery and strike-throwing since last summer, though he didn't get a chance to show them off in game action this spring. He'll pitch at Oklahoma State if he doesn't sign this summer."
"Robby Ashford",160,"CF","Hoover HS","HS SR","Hoover","AL","USA","R","R","One of the better athletes in the 2020 Draft, Ashford is a four-star quarterback recruit who originally planned to play two sports at Mississippi until the Rebels made a football coaching change, prompting him to switch to Oregon. He's the fifth player to participate in both the Under Armour All-America baseball and football games, following Kyler Murray and A.J. Brown, who starred in the NFL as rookies last season, and Jerrion Ealy and Maurice Hampton, who are currently playing both sports in the Southeastern Conference. Ashford's desire to play football and rawness on the diamond make it unlikely that a team could pay him enough to get him to commit full-time to baseball, so he may go undrafted, but based purely on ceiling he could fit in the top three rounds. Ashford's most obvious tool is his speed, as he can produce top-of-the-scale times from home to first and chase balls down from gap to gap in center field. The strength in his 6-foot-4, 204-pound frame and the quickness of his right-handed swing give him the ingredients for plus raw power. And not surprisingly for a quarterback, he has a strong arm that would fit anywhere in the outfield. The huge question with Ashford is whether he'll hit enough to make the most of his pop and his speed on the bases. Playing football detracts from the time he needs to improve at the plate, and his pitch recognition and strike-zone management have looked rudimentary in his rare exposure to high-level competition. The demands of quarterbacking also will cut into his at-bats with the Ducks, so it will be difficult for him to reach his baseball potential."
"Caden Grice",161,"P","Riverside HS","HS SR","Greer","SC","USA","L","L","Scouts are split on whether Grice offers more upside as a slugger or a pitcher, but they all agree that it's a shame he didn't get a full high school senior season to figure it out. Some evaluators see top-of-the-scale raw power, while others see a southpaw with the makings of three solid pitches. He's built along the lines of Joey Gallo, who had a similar profile (albeit with more fastball velocity) coming out of high school. At 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds, Grice has impressive strength and leverage and offers some of the best raw pop in the 2020 Draft. He can topspin balls out of the park to center field, though his left-handed swing is naturally long and he'll need to tighten his strike zone and prove he can catch up to good velocity to make the most of his power. He's a below-average runner but not a clogger, and he has enough athleticism and the solid arm strength to play on the outfield corners. Teams believe Grice prefers to hit, though his swing-and-miss issues eventually could land him on the mound, where he's also a work in progress. He can run his fastball up to 94 mph with some sink but also sits in the upper 80s at times, and his slider and fading changeup have their moments but lack consistency. The Clemson recruit throws strikes but scouts don't love his arm action, which is long in back and features a high elbow."
"Adam Seminaris",162,"P","Long Beach State","4YR JR","Pomona","CA","USA","R","L","Long Beach State has a long history of producing big leaguers, from Evan Longoria to Jered Weaver. Seminaris, who joined the Dirtbags rotation full-time as a sophomore, then pitched well on the Cape last summer and carried that over to the start of the 2020 season, should break that schneid. Seminaris is, in many ways, the prototypical pitchability lefty, one with a four-pitch mix and excellent knowledge of how to use it. While his fastball typically sits 88-90 mph, and tops out at 93 mph, it plays up because he commands it so well and there??s deception in his delivery. He throws two breaking balls, with his mid-70s curve a bit better than his low-80s slider. But his best secondary offering is his plus changeup that misses bats and gets weak contact. Seminaris has always thrown a ton of strikes and was taking a step forward before the season was shut down this spring. He has a limited ceiling, but with his feel for pitching and track record, he??ll be enticing as a potential back-end starting pitcher."
"Stevie Emanuels",163,"P","Washington","4YR JR","Seattle","WA","USA","R","R","The best right-hander to come out of the University of Washington was Tim Lincecum, a first-round pick of the Giants in 2006. Emanuels won't enter into those kinds of conversations, but after two years as a reliever and a solid Cape Cod League performance, followed by a move to the rotation this spring, he was opening eyes before the season shut down. Long and athletic, the 6-foot-5 Emanuels has an ideal pitcher??s frame, though he doesn??t always take full advantage of it. He throws his low-90s fastball, one that will touch 95 mph, with a loose arm and the ball jumps out of his hand, getting on the hitter in a hurry to create a lot of late swings. That happens even though he??s a bit of a short-strider with his delivery and finishes a bit upright. He??ll sometimes show two distinct breaking balls, but they often blend into an average pitch that is more slider than curve. He??ll mix in an average changeup as well. Emanuels tends to be around the strike zone, though he doesn??t have pinpoint command. It??s possible there??s more in the tank velocity-wise as he adds weight and strength. A team taking him would likely send him out as a starter to see if what he showed this spring is for real, knowing that everything would tick up a bit if he ended up back in the bullpen."
"Johnny Ray",164,"P","TCU","4YR JR","Quincy","IL","USA","R","R","Ray has worked just 29 1/3 innings in three seasons of college, missing all of 2018 at Illinois State following Tommy John surgery. After emerging as one of the nation's best junior college prospects at John A. Logan (Ill.) CC that fall, he pitched in just eight frames last spring because of an oblique injury, then made four starts at Texas Christian in 2020 before the college season ended prematurely. His best outing came in front of several scouts in February, when he beat Minnesota and projected early first-round pick Max Meyer with a two-hit shutout. Ray can run his fastball up to 97 mph but usually pitches at 91-94 with late running action. He utilizes two distinct breaking balls, an upper-70s curveball with good depth and a cutter/slider that can reach 90 mph. He also exhibits feel for an upper-70s changeup with some fade and sink. All four of Ray's pitches can flash as plus, though he lacks consistency because of his inexperience. He has cleaned up his delivery some since injuring his elbow in high school and while he doesn't have the smoothest mechanics, he has thrown strikes in his limited action. His stuff could fit in the top three rounds but it's unclear how much teams will hold his lack of track record against him."
"Joe Boyle",165,"P","Notre Dame","4YR JR","O'Fallon","MO","USA","R","R","Though he could have factored into the top three rounds as a Kentucky high schooler in 2017, Boyle opted out of the Draft because he was set on attending Notre Dame. He had trouble throwing strikes in his first two seasons with the Fighting Irish and totaled just 27 2/3 innings as a result. He did make progress in the Cape Cod League last summer, giving some hope that he can harness his electric stuff, but he walked 13 batters in 8 1/3 innings during the shortened 2020 college season. Boyle has the best arm strength in the 2020 Draft. His fastball reached 102 mph in the Northwoods League during the summer of 2018 and hit 101 at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament and on the Cape in 2019. He can operate in the upper 90s for several innings at a time while getting riding action on his heater. Boyle also can overpower hitters with an upper-80s slider but has yet to show much of a third pitch. His huge 6-foot-7 frame adds to his intimidation factor yet he has difficulty keeping all his long levers in sync and locating his pitches where he wants. He's a decent athlete, so there's optimism that he can continue to improve when he gets more regular innings in pro ball."
"Luke Little",166,"P","San Jacinto College North","JC J2","Charlotte","NC","USA","L","L","San Jacinto (Texas) JC has produced 18 big league pitchers, most notably Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte, as well as Nationals 2019 first-rounder Jackson Rutledge. The Gators' three best arms -- right-hander Brandon Birdsell and lefties Little and Mitchell Parker -- all could fit in the first five rounds this year. Little tweaked his back after his first start in February and missed four weeks, then came back to make four relief appearances before the season ended early. Little has the highest maximum velocity of any southpaw in the 2020 Draft and created buzz when video surfaced of him hitting 105 mph in an indoor workout in May, though he tends to work at 93-96 in longer outings. He has made progress with his secondary pitches but they still need more work. His low-80s slider is his No. 2 option, and he also has come up with an upper-70s curveball and a nascent changeup. Little has gotten in much better shape this season, dropping 30 pounds from his massive 6-foot-8 frame and doing a better job of repeating his delivery in limited action, though scouts still don't care for his arm action or mechanics. He tallied 86 strikeouts versus 39 walks in 44 1/3 innings in two years at San Jacinto, and it's difficult to project him as more than a reliever who can air out his fastball in short stints. If he doesn't sign this summer, he'll pitch at South Carolina in 2021."
"Joey Wiemer",167,"LF","Cincinnati","4YR JR","Sylvania","OH","USA","R","R","Cincinnati's best prospect since Ian Happ was a Cubs first-rounder in 2016, Wiemer offers some of the best tools in the 2020 college crop but little track record of doing damage at the plate. He has a big league body (6-foot-5, 215 pounds) and three tools that grade as plus or better, yet he's a career .264/.379/.408 hitter for the Bearcats and slugged just .354 with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer. Wiemer's bat speed, strength and leverage give him plus raw power from the right side of the plate, but he's still figuring how to translate it into production. He utilizes a big leg kick and he has an uphill, max-effort swing and timing issues that lead to a lot of groundball contact. He probably will need to overhaul his stroke at the next level, though he does show some patience at the plate. Wiemer has plus speed and an aggressive nature on the bases, showing a knack for stealing bags. He has well above-average arm strength and has hit 98 mph on the mound, though a lack of control undermined him when Cincinnati briefly tried to use him as a closer this spring. He has played left field for the Bearcats, though his quickness and arm would suggest he can handle any outfield assignment."
"Jack Blomgren",168,"SS","Michigan","4YR JR","Milton","WI","USA","R","R","A classic glue guy who helps hold a team together, Blomgren won Michigan's shortstop job as a freshman and has started 137 of the Wolverines' 141 games over the last three seasons. He hit .360 at the 2019 College World Series as Michigan lost in the finals, its best finish since winning the 1962 national title. His makeup stands out more than any of his individual tools but he makes contact at the plate and plays in the field. Blomgren's speed and pure arm strength are just average, but his range and throwing are better than that. He has reliable hands, good instincts that help him reach grounders and a quick release and internal clock that allow him to get the ball across the diamond in plenty of time. He's capable of playing shortstop at the next level and has the skills to serve all over the infield in a utility role if needed. It remains to be seen whether Blomgren can provide enough offensive impact to profile as a big league regular. He makes consistent contact with a flat right-handed swing and his patience and knack for getting hit by pitches enhance his on-base skills. He sprays line drives to all fields but offers ordinary bat speed and little power, as evidenced by his .357 slugging percentage in college."
"Carson Ragsdale",169,"P","South Florida","4YR SR","Wesley Chapel","FL","USA","R","R","Ragsdale spent his first two years at the University of South Florida missing bats, and walking hitters, coming out of the bullpen. He then missed the 2019 season because he needed Tommy John surgery. A move to the rotation upon his return in 2020 created some serious buzz for the big right-hander, though he was only able to make four starts before the season was ended. There??s a lot to like about Ragsdale, starting with his 6-foot-8 frame that allows him to throw with a good downhill plane. He features a fastball that??s typically in the 91-95 mph range right now, but there??s room for more velocity in the future. He couples it with a curveball that flashes plus and can be a real strikeout pitch when he lands it in the strike zone. He has a changeup, but it??s a distant third pitch and will need to be developed at the next level. Ragsdale threw a lot of strikes this spring, but is still more control than command at this point. Given that scouts only saw four outings from Ragsdale as USF??s Sunday starter, there??s very limited track record for teams to look at, but his size and arm strength, even if it ends up in the bullpen, could be enough for teams to take a chance on him in this year??s Draft."
"Casey Opitz",170,"C","Arkansas","4YR JR","Centennial","CO","USA","S","R","Since turning down the Indians as a 27th-rounder out of high school in 2017, Opitz has become one of the best defensive catchers in college baseball. He had the best caught-stealing percentage (48 percent) and fewest passed balls (two in 58 games) among Southeastern Conference backstops in 2019, when he helped the Razorbacks reach the College World Series in his first season as a starter. He also impressed behind the plate with the U.S. collegiate national team last summer, splitting time with projected first-round pick Patrick Bailey. Opitz's pure arm strength grades closer to average but plays at plus because he has such a quick transfer and release and he makes extremely accurate throws. He's a solid receiver and blocker who moves well, and he earns praise for his game-calling skills and leadership. He's the complete package defensively, which could lead to a long big league career as at least a backup. As much as scouts love his work as a catcher, they're not sold Opitz will hit enough to be a regular at the next level after watching him bat .253 with four homers in 93 college games. A switch-hitter who's better from the left side, he has a patient approach but doesn't make much hard contact. He has added some strength, shows glimpses of raw power as a lefty and performed better during the brief 2020 season, offering some hope that there's more offensive production to come."
"Jimmy Glowenke",171,"SS","Dallas Baptist","4YR JR","Chicago","IL","USA","R","R","The Missouri Valley Conference freshman and defensive player of the year in 2018, Glowenke finished fourth in the league in batting (.328) last spring and then hit .296 in the Cape Cod League. One of the better hitters among this year's college shortstops, he missed the first weekend of his junior year recovering from offseason elbow surgery and didn't play in the field before the season ended. He could go in the first five rounds and is a righty-hitting version of the only Dallas Baptist infielder ever to do so (Ryan Goins, fourth round, 2009), albeit with less arm strength. Glowenke's lone better-than-average tool is his bat, as he makes line-drive contact with ease. He controls the strike zone well and enhances his on-base ability by getting hit by more than his share of pitches. He can provide some doubles and perhaps 10-12 homers per season at the next level, but he didn't drive the ball with wood bats on the Cape.  Glowenke's below-average speed almost certainly will push him to second base in pro ball. He's a sure-handed defender at shortstop, but he lacks the range to stay there. His average arm may be enough to get by at third base in a utility role, though neither it nor his power fits the profile to play regularly at the hot corner."
"Blake Dunn",172,"CF","Western Michigan","4YR JR","Holland","MI","USA","R","R","Western Michigan hasn't produced a big leaguer since Adam Rosales went in the 12th round of the 2005 Draft, but Dunn has the upside to end that drought. He earned 16 letters in four sports at Saugatuck (Mich.) High, finishing as the second-leading scorer in state football history (827 points), winning six state championships in hurdles and scoring 51 points in a single basketball game. He's one of the top college athletes in the Draft but a rough summer in the Cape Cod League has raised questions about his hitting ability. Dunn has been clocked at 6.32 seconds in a 60-yard dash on artificial turf, and he translates his plus-plus speed into dynamic basestealing ability and quality defense in center field. His arm is also a weapon, with his fastball registering up to 95 mph during his sporadic appearances on the mound. He also offers plus raw power from the right side of the plate. Those tools could have landed Dunn in the top two or three rounds if he hadn't hit .229/.338/.298 with a 25 percent strikeout rate on the Cape. He has some timing issues at the plate and will chase balls up in the strike zone, though he does employ a patient approach. He has yet to prove he can tap into his power on a regular basis, hitting just seven homers in 108 college games."
"Jacob Teter",173,"1B","Florida Southern College","4YR JR","Melbourne","FL","USA","L","L","Lightly recruited out of high school, Teter landed at Division II Florida Southern and immediately showed off a good approach at the plate, earning conference Freshman of the Year honors. After another off-the-radar, but solid, season as a sophomore, he got noticed by scouts with a very solid performance in the Cape Cod League last summer and he had gotten off to a very good start over his first 22 games this spring before the shutdown. The 6-foot-6 first baseman creates an imposing presence in the left side of the batter??s box. He??s had impressive plate discipline throughout his college career, with more walks than strikeouts and even though there??s some length to his swing, he??s shown an ability to make consistent contact. There??s plenty of raw power for him to tap into, something he??s done at times in college, and with more to come once he learns to lift the ball more consistently. Limited to first base, Teter is capable at the infield corner, though it??s clearly his bat that will have teams interested, especially those who like college performers. Playing against Division II competition might make some pause, but his Cape performance should help offset that for teams intrigued by his left-handed power potential."
"Christian Chamberlain",174,"P","Oregon State","4YR JR","Grand Junction","CO","USA","L","L","While fellow Draft prospect Kevin Abel was the star freshman pitcher for Oregon State??s College World Series title run in 2018, Chamberlain made a strong contribution as a freshman reliever himself, tying a CWS record with 11 strikeouts in one relief outing. After his sophomore year coming out of the pen, the left-hander moved to the rotation as a junior in 2020 and raised his profile with a very solid four-start beginning to the spring. The sub-6-footer has a three-pitch mix that could give him the chance to start. He can run his fastball up to 95 mph, though as a starter his velocity backed off after a few innings to around 90-91 mph. Chamberlain throws it with good riding life, and he likes to throw it up in the zone to miss bats. His curve is close to a 12-to-6 breaking ball with good bite that can miss a lot of bats, one that was responsible for eight of his 11 K??s in that CWS performance. He can mix in an average changeup as well. While Chamberlain has missed a ton of bats throughout his Beavers career, striking out 12 per nine -- a rate that spiked to 13.9 over his four starts -- he??s struggled to throw strikes consistently. A team taking him in the Draft might send him out as a starter to see if he can refine his command, but there??s a good chance he ends up back in the bullpen, where his fastball-curve combination would play up."
"Kyle Hurt",175,"P","USC","4YR JR","Rancho Santa Fe","CA","USA","R","R","Hurt was a Top 100 Draft prospect coming out of the San Diego high school ranks in 2017, but a combination of a knee injury and a strong commitment to Southern Cal led to him not being selected until the 34th round and he headed to campus. He??s been up-and-down for much of his Trojans career, though he did take over as the Friday night starter during his sophomore year, a role he held at the start of the 2020 season before things were shut down. Hurt has long had the size and pure stuff to make him a very strong pitching prospect. His fastball will sit in the 92-94 range and he will top out at 97 mph, and he could find more consistent velocity at the top end of that scale as he continues to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which could be a plus pitch in time. He throws both a hard slider in the upper-80s and a slower, upper-70s curve, both of which show glimpses but are inconsistent breaking pitches. The right-hander hasn??t always commanded his stuff well or maintained it deep into starts, with the sharpness of his stuff often varying from outing to outing. He entered the spring as one of the more enigmatic college pitching prospects in this class and there wasn??t really enough time for scouts?? questions to be completely answered this spring."
"Sterlin Thompson",176,"3B","North Marion HS","HS SR","Ocala","FL","USA","L","R","North Marion High School in Central Florida has had four players drafted from its baseball program, none since 1993 and none higher than James Morgan, a 16th-round pick of the Indians back in 1990. While Thompson did not participate in many of the big showcase events last summer, an All-Tournament showing at Perfect Game??s World Wood Bat Association World Championship in Jupiter, Fla., last fall put him more on the map, and there was an up arrow next to his name with a good start to his spring before the season was shut down. Long and lean, Thompson has a projectable body and he should be able to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. That means there should be even more power to come from his nice left-handed swing that already has good launch angle and loft, giving him the chance to be an average hitter with at least average pop in the future. While scouts feel confident he??ll hit, there??s less certainty about where his long-term defensive home will be. A shortstop in high school, Thompson has decent hands and a strong arm, but his actions can be a bit long and he??s likely going to fill out and slow down more. Some evaluators see a move to third, while others think he might be suited to be an offensive-minded second baseman. And some feel that a team taking him should just put him in left field and let his bat play. If the Draft doesn??t work out and he heads to the University of Florida, he would be eligible again in 2022 as a sophomore."
"Will Klein",177,"P","Eastern Illinois","4YR JR","Bloomington","IN","USA","R","R","Eastern Illinois' best prospect since Tyler Kehler went in 2009's supplemental first round to the Angels, Klein recorded a 5.74 ERA in his first two college seasons while serving mostly as a reliever. He broke out in the Northwoods League last summer, reaching 99 mph during the wood-bat circuit's all-star game and finishing with a 0.86 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 21 innings. After the Panthers moved him into their rotation this spring, he continued to make progress with his breaking ball and control. As a starter in 2020, Klein worked at 92-94 mph and topped out at 96 with his four-seam fastball, which is fairly straight but does feature some riding action. He also flashed a solid curveball with power and depth. He began incorporating a changeup into his repertoire, but it lacks velocity separation from his heater and lags well behind his other two offerings. While Klein shaved his walk rate from 9.8 per nine innings in his first two college seasons to 4.8 in his truncated third, he'll need to upgrade his control and command in order to remain a starter in pro ball. He has a strong 6-foot-5 frame built for durability but probably will wind up in the bullpen. In shorter stints, he could focus on his two best pitches and his fastball might park in the upper 90s."
"Nate Wohlgemuth",178,"P","Owasso HS","HS SR","Tulsa","OK","USA","R","R","Wohlgemuth hit 96 mph with his fastball as an Owasso (Okla.) High freshman in 2017, stamping him as the school's best prospect since Dylan Bundy went fourth overall in the 2011 Draft. He battled his control on the showcase circuit last summer but finished with one of the best performances in the history of the World Wood Bat Association World Championship, tossing a 14-strikeout no-hitter in October. Despite his velocity, he's a short high school right-hander with a reliever profile, so he might not fit in the first five rounds. When he's fresh, Wohlgemuth can sit in the mid-90s for multiple innings and top out at 98 mph with some armside run on his fastball. He lacks angle and plane on his heater, however, and there's some question as to how many bats he'll miss if he sits at 92-95 with more regular use. His mid-70s curveball shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch but also lacks consistency, and his mid-80s fading changeup is a more reliable offering. Though he's just 5-foot-11, and his listed height may be generous, Wohlgemuth doesn't throw with excessive effort and uses his legs well in his delivery. He has fairly simple mechanics and athleticism that should allow him to fill the strike zone, but his control and command are very scattered. The Arkansas recruit is strong but physically mature, so it's difficult to project his stuff getting any firmer, and he'll be Draft-eligible as a 21-year-old sophomore in 2022 if he attends college."
"Bobby Seymour",179,"1B","Wake Forest","4YR JR","Harvey","IL","USA","L","R","Seymour started at first base for Wake Forest as a freshman and exploded as a sophomore in 2019, winning Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year honors after leading the league in hitting (.377) and NCAA Division I in RBI (92, the most at that level since Buster Posey had 93 in 2008). An appendectomy cut short his summer in the Cape Cod League and with the U.S. collegiate national team, though he hit well with wood bats in the Northwoods League in 2018. He should go in the first five rounds as one of the better pure hitters in the college ranks. Despite being 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, Seymour is a hit-over-power guy. He employs a very controlled approach during games, making hard line-drive contact and using the opposite field well rather than swinging for the fences. He's strong and displays at least solid raw power during batting practice, but some scouts worry about the fact that he homered just twice in 243 plate appearances with wood in two years of college summer league play. Seymour has to provide offensive production because he doesn't offer much else. He's a well below-average runner with below-average arm strength, limiting his defensive options to first base. An adequate defender at best, he could wind up at DH, which would increase the demands on his bat."
"Zach Brzykcy",180,"P","Virginia Tech","4YR JR","Hickory","NC","USA","R","R","Brzykcy has been a reliever since he set foot on Virginia Tech??s campus from the North Carolina high school ranks three years ago, showcasing his power stuff but struggling mightily to find the strike zone with it. He opened a lot of eyes in the Cape Cod League last summer, throwing strikes and leading the league in saves en route to being named the league??s reliever of the year. He did not bring that feel for pitching with him at the start of the spring, but his pure stuff is still very enticing. The 6-foot-2 right-hander has the kind of fastball-slider combination you love to see coming out of the bullpen late in games. He touches triple digits fairly regularly, throwing his fastball anywhere in the 94-101 mph range, though it does get hit more than it should at times. His hard slider is a legitimate strikeout pitch and a nasty plus breaking ball.  The big issue is with Brzykcy??s command. While he has struck out nearly 14 batters per nine innings at Virginia Tech, he??s also walked a whopping 10.5. The team that believes it can help Brzycky become the reliever everyone saw on the Cape will be the one to take him."
"Patrick Reilly",181,"P","Christian Brothers Academy","HS SR","Long Branch","NJ","USA","R","R","Over the summer, Northeast area high school pitchers like Alex Santos and Jason Savacool raised their stock on the showcase circuit. Reilly didn??t pitch much over the summer, but he opened a ton of eyes with his performance at Perfect Game??s WWBA World Championship in Jupiter, Fla., in the fall. Teams that saw him there were excited to follow up on him as the weather warmed up in his native New Jersey this spring, something that never happened because of coronavirus. Reilly has the ingredients to be a power starting pitcher in the future, but it??s all a bit raw. He was up to 96 mph during his start in Jupiter, and there??s a ton of projection in his 6-foot-3, 210-pound frame to point to more consistent velocity in the future. He can spin a breaking ball -- a pitch that flashes as a plus curve, but can get loopy and slurvy at times -- with some evaluators thinking he could eventually have two distinct options. His changeup is clearly behind his fastball-breaking ball combination, but there is some belief it could become a usable offering with more repetition. While he??s raw and doesn??t have great command right now, Reilly does have a workable delivery and clean arm action that point to decent control in the future. There??s a lot to like with this right-hander, but teams haven??t seen that much of him, making it trickier to figure out if they can sign him away from his commitment to Vanderbilt, the school he switched to from Northeastern following his performance in Jupiter."
"Kala'i Rosario",182,"RF","Waiakea HS","HS SR","Papaikou","HI","USA","R","R","In four of the last six Drafts, Hawaii has seen a high schooler get drafted in the top five rounds, headlined by 2014 first-round pick Kodi Medeiros. Rosario, who showed off his right-handed bat over last summer at events like the Area Code Games, gives the island state the chance to make it 5-for-7. All talk around Rosario centers around his bat, more specifically his plus-plus raw power. Rosario beat fellow Draft prospect Blaze Jordan in the Area Code Games home run derby last summer. He can get a little pull-happy and out front on his swing at times, and there are some concerns about his ability to hit enough to get to that raw pop consistently in games at the next level. Rosario is a decent athlete, and he does play center field in high school, but as a tick-below-average runner who is already fairly physically mature, he is likely going to be limited to a corner, with left field his likely destination. He does have the power potential to profile well in an outfield corner, and that could be enough for the California Baptist recruit to get drafted."
"Jamal O'Guinn",183,"3B","USC","4YR JR","Fresno","CA","USA","R","R","A three-year starter at Southern Cal, O??Guinn showed glimpses of his ability over his first two years in the Trojans' lineup. He performed better as a Cape Cod League All-Star last summer and had gotten off to a hot start during his junior year before the shutdown, putting him in position to possibly become just the third USC hitter to go in the top five rounds in the last 10 years. Those who like O??Guinn point to his 6-foot-4, 220-pound frame, his offensive potential and his plate discipline. The right-handed hitter has always drawn a ton of walks, with a .420 on-base percentage in his Southern Cal career. He??ll show off plus raw power in batting practice, but hasn??t always tapped into it in games.  O??Guinn played third base this year because the Trojans needed someone at the hot corner, but while he??s not a bad athlete with an average arm, it??s unclear whether he can stick there. He??s played the first base and corner outfield spots in the past, and he could be fine in left. There??ll be pressure for his bat to produce at any of those spots, and there are teams who think it might, giving him the chance to be the first Trojans hitter to go in the top five rounds since catcher Jeremy Martinez was a fourth-round pick in 2016."
"Taylor Dollard",184,"P","Cal Poly","4YR JR","Sherman Oaks","CA","USA","R","R","After playing his high school ball in Encino, Dollard went north a bit in California to become a part of Cal Poly??s pitching staff. He spent his first two years coming out of the bullpen, earning first-team All-Big West Conference honors as a sophomore. After a strong turn in relief on the Cape last summer, Dollard looked very good in his first chance as a starter for the Mustangs this spring. Tall and athletic, Dollard has the chance to have a four-pitch mix that he knows how to use well, even if none of his individual offerings jump off the page. Velocity-wise, his fastball only sits in the 88-90 mph range, topping out at around 93 mph, but it plays up because of its sink and Dollard??s ability to command and manipulate it so well. His 77-80 mph slider is his out pitch and flashes plus at times, though he doesn??t always throw it hard enough and he can fold in a low-70s curveball with depth as well. Dollard doesn??t throw a ton of changeups, but he shows very good feel for it and it could end up being his best secondary pitch in the future. Dollard has walked just 2.2 per nine in his college career and walked only 1.3 over his four starts this spring. Some see a little Tom Eshelman in him, the Fullerton command artist who went in the second round back in 2015, though Dollard isn??t expected to come off the board quite as early."
"Alex Toral",185,"1B","Miami","4YR JR","Hialeah","FL","USA","L","L","After a strong summer on the showcase circuit, Toral began his senior year of high school in 2017 in Florida as an intriguing power hitting first baseman worth following. But he struggled that spring and that, combined with his strong commitment to Miami, led to him not being drafted at all. Three years later, not a whole lot has changed other than some production against good college competition. Toral??s carrying tool is his power. He has easily plus raw power and is capable of hitting the ball out to all fields, and he did hit 24 homers during his sophomore season with the Hurricanes. That power comes with a ton of swing-and-miss concerns, with Toral having struck out in more than 26 percent of his college plate appearances. He does help offset that a bit with a solid walk rate, and his approach was improved -- albeit in a smaller sample size -- this spring. The first baseman??s bat is going to have to play because he??s a well-below-average runner who has been described as a ???bull in a china shop?? defensively. There??s risk here, but teams that covet legitimate power might be willing to roll the dice."
"Hunter Haas",186,"SS","Corona Del Sol HS","HS SR","Phoenix","AZ","USA","R","R","Over the last few years, there??s been a bit of a battle for the title of best Arizona high school shortstop in this class between Haas and Carson Tucker. Tucker has taken a large step forward to likely claim the overall crown, but Haas has the skills to stay up the middle, tools he showed off last summer to land a spot on the 18 and Under National Team for USA Baseball. Haas is the kind of player you like more the longer you see him, one who gets high marks as a gritty ???baseball player?? type more than for any individual tool. He does stand out with his glove work, with excellent hands and instincts at shortstop. He likely has enough arm to stay at the position, though some see that and a lack of foot speed as an indication he might eventually be better suited for second. Haas controls the bat very well, but there??s a lack of impact that concerns some. A player who is more than the sum of his parts, Haas is more instincts-and-feel than tools-oriented. Some see him more as a really good college player. Should he go on to Arizona State, he could be the type who emerges as a Cadyn Grenier type, the Oregon State shortstop who was the 37th overall pick in the 2018 Draft."

This year??s crop, while thinner, is also topped by a shortstop, Odina, who has some tools, albeit in a small package. Scouts love the way Ondina plays the game and think he has the chance to stay up the middle. He has excellent hands and footwork, with his speed helping him have excellent range, and it seems like he has enough arm to play at shortstop long-term. He??s also shown he can handle any infield position as well as run well enough to play center field, important attributes if he ends up being a utiity type. He has good bat-to-ball skills with the ability to hit the gaps, but there is concern about a lack of strength and how much he can impact the baseball. Ondina is generously listed at 5-foot-8 and a lot of scouts would like to see him go on to Florida International to see if he can add strength to his small frame. Teams who believe he??s a future everyday shortstop might take a chance and help him get bigger and stronger with pro instruction."
"Gino Groover",188,"SS","The Walker School","HS SR","East Point","GA","USA","R","R","Groover wasn't a regular on the high school showcase circuit but impressed evaluators with his bat speed at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship last October. He's a product of The Walker School (Marietta, Ga.), which also spawned No. 1 overall pick Mike Ivie and a second big leaguer in David Hale. Though he has been scouted less than most players on this list and the shortened high school season didn't help his cause, he's intriguing as a possible middle infielder with offensive upside. Groover's whippy right-handed swing and projectable 6-foot-3 frame could translate into average or better pop as he gains strength and experience. He already shows a knack for making hard line-drive contact, fueling optimism that he'll get to most of his power potential. He doesn't try to do too much at the plate, keeping his stroke compact and not expanding the strike zone. A high school shortstop, Groover almost certainly will change positions at the next level. He has reliable hands and good instincts, but his average speed and arm strength fit better at second base. Some scouts think the UNC Charlotte recruit could wind up at third base if his arm gets stronger or an outfield corner if he slows down as he fills out."
"Magdiel Cotto",189,"P","Nation Ford HS","HS SR","Charlotte","NC","USA","L","L","Yet another prep pitcher denied a full opportunity to show what he could do as a senior, Cotto whetted the appetites of scouts with a breakout performance at the Super 60 showcase in February. Relatively unknown after moving from Pennsylvania to South Carolina as a junior, he made a name for himself by reaching 95 mph with his fastball and pairing it with a sharp slider. He wasn't as electric during his truncated high school season, increasing the chances he winds up attending college at South Carolina. A big left-hander, Cotto operated more at 87-92 mph this spring after sitting at 92-94 during the Super 60 workout. He uses his 6-foot-3 frame and high three-quarters slot to create downhill plane on his fastball, which also features some running action. He has tightened his breaking ball, a low-80s slider with solid potential, and also exhibits some feel for his changeup. Cotto doesn't throw with much effort, though he's more physical than athletic and doesn't pound the strike zone. With a chance for a three-pitch mix and a durable build, he offers the upside of a starter. But evaluators wanted to see him sustain his Super 60 performance, so it's unclear where he might go in the Draft."
"Elijah Cabell",190,"OF","Florida State","4YR SO","Altamonte Springs","FL","USA","R","R","Two years ago, Cabell??s raw tools coming out of the TNXL Baseball Academy in Florida put him at No. 101 on MLB Pipeline??s Top 200 and got him drafted by the Brewers in the 14th round of the 2018 Draft. He made a late switch from a commitment to LSU to one with Florida State in the middle of June to keep him in-state after he didn??t sign with Milwaukee. Now back as a Draft-eligible sophomore, he??s still very much the toolsy-but-raw player he was in high school. Cabell can do a lot of things well on the baseball field, but his standout tool might be his raw power. Some scouts put a 70 on his raw pop, but there are a lot of questions about his ability to get to that power with any consistency given how frequently he strikes out. He was hitting more homers this spring before the season was cancelled and he draws walks, but his inability to recognize pitches is very concerning. Far from a burner, Cabell is athletic enough to be a capable defensive outfielder with plenty of arm strength for an outfield corner. It??s easy to love the tools, but will teams believe he's going to make enough contact to keep him from heading back for his junior year with the Seminoles?"
"Jackson Fristoe",191,"P","Paducah Tilghman HS","HS SR","Paducah","KY","USA","R","R","Fristoe's stuff and performance varied on the showcase circuit last summer, as he mixed good and rough outings at the PDP League, struggled to throw strikes at East Coast Pro and rebounded with his best effort at the Area Code Games. Scouts were looking forward to seeing what progress he might make this spring, but the Kentucky high school season got cancelled before he even took the mound. That may make it difficult to take him early enough to divert him from Mississippi State, where he'd be Draft-eligible as a 21-year-old sophomore in 2022. Fristoe's fastball ranged from 88-90 mph to 91-94 at different times last summer, featuring some armside run. He has a very projectable 6-foot-4 build and could sit in the mid-90s once he matures physically. He lacks consistency with his secondary offerings but shows the promise of a four-pitch arsenal with flashes of a low-80s slider, a curveball with more depth than power and the makings of a changeup. Because he's still growing into his tall frame, Fristoe doesn't always keep his long limbs in sync in his delivery on a consistent basis. His control and command are still works in progress but should get better as he improves his strength and mechanics. He could blossom into a top-two-rounds prospect after a couple of seasons in the Southeastern Conference."
"Max Carlson",192,"P","Burnsville HS","HS SR","Edina","MN","USA","R","R","Sam Carlson saw his fastball jump from 88-92 mph as a Minnesota high school junior to 93-97 as a senior, propelling him into the second round and a $2-million bonus from the Mariners. His younger brother Max isn't as big or projectable as Sam was, but scouts were eager to see if he might make a similar leap as a senior this spring. He impressed in a February bullpen workout but didn't get a chance to pitch in games, which will make it tough to draft him high enough to sign him away from a North Carolina commitment. Carlson thrived on the showcase circuit last summer while his fastball sat mostly in the upper 80s with some run and sink, then opened some eyes by operating at 90-94 mph at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He has the makings of a pair of solid secondary pitches in his slider and circle changeup, both of which park in the upper 70s. His curveball has gotten sharper as he has gotten stronger, while his changeup features fade and sink. Carlson's stuff plays up because he commands it well, showing the ability to spot his fastball on both sides of the plate and sneak it by hitters up in the strike zone on occasion. Scouts also like his mound presence and competitiveness. His 6-foot-1 frame doesn't have a lot of projection remaining but he's more polished than most high school pitchers."
"Tyson Guerrero",193,"P","Lower Columbia College","JC J2","Centralia","WA","USA","L","L","Guerrero started his collegiate career as a two-way player at Washington State in 2019 as an outfielder and a relief pitcher. He transferred to Lower Columbia Community College in Washington, making him eligible for the Draft this year. Still hitting and pitching, his Draft stock on the mound jumped when he showed better stuff, albeit in a very small sample size, early this spring. As a high schooler, Guerrero was an undersized player who needed college experience. He??s since added good weight and strength, and that??s resulted in better stuff on the mound. While the southpaw only had two starts before the shutdown, he showed off his quick arm and willingness to attack hitters with a potential three-pitch mix. He??ll get his fastball up to the mid-90s at times and his curveball gives him a true out pitch, one that bites with late, downer action. He has a changeup, but it??s behind the other two offerings. That wipeout breaking ball was on full display in his second start of the spring, when he recorded 15 strikeouts in six innings. While he??s not going to hit at the next level, the athleticism he shows in playing both ways should help him on the mound as he gets more reps, with improved command likely. He doesn??t have the same command, but some in the area think he reminds them of another small, but athletic lefty from the region who was a first-rounder in 2013: Marco Gonzales."
"Carson Taylor",194,"C","Virginia Tech","4YR SO","Atlanta","GA","USA","S","R","Taylor got considerable playing time as a freshman at Virginia Tech in 2019, splitting time between catching and first base. He became the Hokies?? primary catcher as a Draft-eligible sophomore and was added to the 2020 Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year Award watch list. He was off to a very hot start before the season was ended, raising his profile especially among teams who value college performers. Taylor has considerable bat speed from both sides of the plate. He??s shown a good feel for the strike zone and has walked more than he??s struck out in his college career. While there??s a lot of raw power to tap into, Taylor gets pull-happy and out front on his swing too often to get to it consistently. He can make hard contact, but pitches on the outer third of the plate gave him trouble. While he does have an average arm behind the plate, his overall receiving skills are below average, leading to some concerns about his ability to stick there. But there could be teams interested in seeing if that will work and buying the bat, perhaps looking at a move to first base or left field, or at least splitting time among positions in the future."
"Dylan MacLean",195,"P","Central Catholic HS","HS SR","Portland","OR","USA","R","L","There??s no question that the best high school arm in the state of Oregon belongs to Mick Abel, a likely first-round pick. No. 2 on that list, and the best lefty from the area, is MacLean, a super-projectable southpaw who entices with his ability to command his stuff as well as potential future gains in velocity and stuff. MacLean has long been known for his feel for pitching, but as a tall, skinny lefty who was throwing in the mid-80s at the Area Code Games last summer, he seemed ticketed to head to the University of Washington to become an outstanding Draft prospect three years from now. But while he didn??t really get to pitch this spring, he did touch 92 mph in workouts and on video. While that doesn??t automatically translate to that much velocity increase in game situations, it is a sign that he has added strength to his 6-foot-3 frame.  His fastball already played up because of his ability to command it to all quadrants of the strike zone. His low-70s curveball has some depth and his changeup gives him a third at-least future average pitch, all coming from a fluid arm action. There??d be some risk involved in terms of drafting him and signing him away form his Huskies commitment, but the ceiling might be enough to convince teams to take a chance."
"Braiden Ward",196,"CF","Washington","4YR JR","Merced","CA","USA","L","R","As a kid, Ward was a standout BMX racer. In high school, he was the goalie on the El Capitan High School Water Polo team. But his skills on the baseball field, most notably his speed, got him to the University of Washington, where he??s been a starter for three years. A Cape Cod League All-Star last summer, he led the PAC-12 in stolen bases all three seasons, including the most recent one shortened by the pandemic.  Ward has very close to top-of-the-scale speed, leading some to say he??s like the college version of Florida prepster Enrique Bradfield Jr. Not only does he record plus-plus times in the 60 and home to first, but he has outstanding base-stealing instincts and is a threat to run on any pitch. He uses a slashing approach at the plate and can shoot the ball to all fields, and while he??s not a power hitter, there??s more strength than you??d think when looking at his frame. Ward??s speed combined with his excellent instincts add up to a plus defender in the outfield, albeit one with a fringy arm, who will be able to play center for a long time. His offensive profile might be a bit limited, but that speed tool is a hard one to find. That, along with a track record of using that speed well against good competition, should help him when the Draft comes around."
"Jacob Berry",197,"3B","Queen Creek HS","HS SR","Cortez","CO","USA","S","R","Scouts went to Arizona early and often during the abbreviated spring season, largely to see the deep college crop that starts with No. 1 prospect Spencer Torkelson at Arizona State. They also could get looks at high school infielders like Carson Tucker, Hunter Haas and Berry, who showed off his power potential as a home run derby participant in the Area Code Games last summer and swung the bat well during his brief senior year. The six-foot corner infielder is a switch-hitter whose best tool is his bat. When it all clicks, he??s an average hitter with plus power that can show up in games. He??s better overall from the left side, with a better feel to hit, more bat speed and more natural loft, but while he??s stiffer from the right side, the strength is still there for him to hit the ball out. While scouts feel like he??s going to hit, there are some questions about where he plays defensively long-term. He??s played shortstop in high school, and has raw arm strength, but doesn??t have the foot speed to stay there. A move to third might make the most sense, and he has caught in the past, while some see a move to left or even a Max Muncy-type of switch to second base if he can be signed away from his commitment to Arizona."
"Levi Prater",198,"P","Oklahoma","4YR JR","Ada","OK","USA","S","L","Oklahoma's entire weekend rotation could fit in the first five rounds of the 2020 Draft. Cade Cavalli is a lock first-rounder and Dane Acker threw a no-hitter against Louisiana State, but Prater had a better ERA (3.42) than either of them this spring. Scouts admire his perseverance and competitiveness, which helped him overcome a lawnmower accident that cost him two fingers on his non-pitching hand when he was not quite 2 years old. Prater's fastball parks around 90-91 mph and tops out at 93 with enough armside run to keep it off barrels. His slider hovers around 80 mph and is tough on left-handers because he sets up on the first-base side of the rubber and throws across his body. His changeup has similar velocity and fades well enough to keep right-handers at bay. Prater's delivery features some effort and his control is just decent, yet his pure stuff plays better than its fringy to average grades. He has managed to outpitch and miss more bats than Cavalli in each of their three seasons together with the Sooners. It's easy to say that Prater profiles more as a middle reliever, but his track record and his makeup may allow him to become a back-of-the-rotation starter."
"Matt Mikulski",199,"P","Fordham","4YR JR","Mohegan Lake","NY","USA","L","L","Fordham University has seen just six players taken in the first 10 rounds of the MLB Draft since Pete Harnisch was a supplemental first rounder back in 1987. Harnisch went on to a 14-year career in the big leagues, almost entirely as a starter. Mikulski should add to that draft total this year. It seems more likely that his path to the big leagues will be out of the bullpen, though he threw well as a starter last summer on the Cape and at the start of his junior season this spring. Mikulski is a southpaw who has the chance to mix three pitches into his arsenal. He??ll throw his fastball up to 95 mph, especially in shorter stints, sitting more in the 90-92 mph range as a starter. His slider is a potential plus pitch -- one that misses a ton of bats -- and he can mix in a usable changeup, as well. Hitters have a hard time picking up the ball thanks to a deceptive delivery with a lot of moving parts. That delivery, which some would call violent, also has led to some command issues, leading many evaluators to think he won??t be able to start long-term. A team taking him could send him out as a starter to see if that can be ironed out, but he could move quickly through a system as a left-handed reliever."
"Ryan Bruno",200,"P","American Heritage School (Delray Beach)","HS SR","Wellington","FL","USA","L","L","Projectable high school pitchers show up in every Draft class and their tendency to be high risk, high reward is well-documented. When those pitchers are left-handed, that can get scouts' attention even more. Bruno, who plays for an American Heritage High School-Delray program in Florida that has produced professional players like Antoan Richardson and, more recently, Jonathan India, has a ton of upside, albeit with some concerns about his control. Bruno has an intriguing combination of size, projection, arm strength and, of course, left-handedness. He can get his fastball up to 95 mph at times, but sits more comfortably in the low-90s. He throws a three-quarters breaking ball that's a bit of a hybrid but looks more like a curve than a slider. He has a changeup, but he tends to get under it and he misses up and to the arm side with it. Bruno struggled to command his stuff over the summer, with a tendency to overthrow with too much effort and a head dive that impacts his release point. When Bruno has managed to not overthrow, his mechanics stay in sync and he's thrown more strikes. With his build, it's easy to dream on growth across the board. His command issues that plagued him over the summer, along with him building up arm strength in the early spring, had him pitching in relief early in the spring, though there were some reports of improved control right when the season shut down. That, along with his commitment to Stanford, make it tougher to see him selected in a five-round Draft."

"Casey Dykstra",NA,"P","Azusa Pacific University","4YR JR","Simi Valley","CA","USA","L","R","Two of Caseys cousins, Cutter (second round, 2008) and Luke (seventh round, 14), were drafted and played professionally, although neither reached the Majors. The most famous Dykstra is Caseys uncle Lenny, a three-time All-Star center fielder and 1986 World Series champion with the Mets."

"Dante Girardi",NA,"SS","Calvary Christian Academy","HS SR","Lake Forest","IL","USA","R","R","Dante, a Florida International commit, is following in the footsteps of his father, Joe, who carved out a long career as a catcher with the Cubs, Rockies, Yankees and Cardinals that included an All-Star selection in 2000."
"Homer Bush Jr.",NA,"CF","Carroll HS","HS SR","Toronto","ON","Canada","R","R","Homer is committed to play at Grand Canyon University. His dad, a second baseman with the same name, hit .380 in limited action as a rookie with the 1998 Yankees, winning a World Series title."
"Jeffrey Hakanson",NA,"P","Central Florida","4YR JR","Tampa","FL","USA","R","R","A reliever for three years at Central Florida, Hakanson was putting up video game numbers before the 2020 season ended, with a 20/1 K/BB ratio, only one hit allowed and six saves in 8 1/3 innings. He comes at hitters with a lot of deception, hiding the ball well and using a slightly lower arm angle. Hes up to 96 mph with his fastball, and his slider has progressed over his time at UCF."
"Jeremy Wu-Yelland",NA,"P","Hawaii","4YR JR","Seattle","WA","USA","L","L","A product of the Pacific Northwest, Wu-Yelland has been a part of Hawaiis bullpen since setting foot on campus as a freshman. While he did get some time as a starter as a sophomore, the southpaw likely profiles best as a reliever because of command issues. After a solid Cape Cod League showing last summer, Wu-Yelland was off to a good start to his 2020 season (0.69 ERA, 11.1 K/9 and a comparatively low 3.5 BB.9), using a fastball that touches the mid-90s, a breaking ball and a solid changeup."
"Dominic Hamel",NA,"P","Dallas Baptist","4YR JR","Chandler","AZ","USA","R","R","A team that places emphasis on pitching metrics could select Hamel in the first five rounds because he has high spin rates on three of his offerings: a low-90s fastball that tops out at 96 mph, a low-80s slider and a mid-70s curveball with more depth than power. A transfer from Yavapai (Ariz.) JC, he one-hit North Carolina for seven innings but had a 7.11 ERA in his other three starts, leaving a mixed impression on scouts. They don't love his arm action or crossfire delivery, though it does provide some deception."
"Zach Pettway",NA,"P","UCLA","4YR JR","Long Beach","CA","USA","R","R","A three-year member of UCLAs rotation, the right-hander took over as the Bruins Friday night starter as a sophomore and had gotten off to a ridiculous start to his 2020 season with a 29/1 K/BB ratio. Pettway is more about his feel for pitching than pure stuff, with a fastball that will average 90 mph, a decent breaking ball and a changeup that serves as his best offering. He offers deception and an ability to command all of his pitches, giving him the chance to start at the next level."
"Tanner Murray",NA,"SS","University of California - Davis","4YR JR","Santa Clara","CA","USA","R","R","A three-year starter at UC-Davis, Murray has built a reputation for making a ton of contact with excellent plate discipline and terrific hand-eye coordination. Hes displayed very little power because of a lack of premium bat speed and leverage in his swing, leading some to worry about how much hell impact the baseball at the next level, though his home college park has a reputation for being pitching-friendly. Some scouts feel he has the chance to be a very good shortstop defensively, and hes also shown the ability to slide over and play third, though that would put more pressure on his bat."
"Tim Tawa",NA,"SS","Stanford","4YR JR","West Linn","OR","USA","R","R","A two-sport high school star who was Oregons Gatorade Player of the Year in football for three years and baseball for one in high school, Tawa was a starter from the get-go as a freshman at Stanford. He wasnt able to back up his freshman year as a sophomore when he dealt with injuries and initially lost the shortstop job this spring. Tawa likes to jump on fastballs and has some pull-side power, though he struggled to identify breaking stuff. His versatility defensively is a plus, as he can play pretty much anywhere on the field as an average runner with an average arm."
"Hunter Parks",NA,"P","Florence-Darlington Tech","JC J1","Gastonia","NC","USA","R","R","A two-way player in high school, Parks made some intriguing strides when he focused on pitching as a junior college freshman. He has a loose arm that now produces 90-95 mph fastballs and 78-82 mph sliders, and there's still projection remaining in his athletic 6-foot-3, 175-pound frame. He's also making progress with his changeup and control, though it's unclear if his 21 innings this spring were enough to convince teams to draft him way from returning to Florence-Darlington Tech for his sophomore season."
"Dane Acker",NA,"P","Oklahoma","4YR JR","College Station","TX","USA","R","R","Acker made Conference USA's 2018 all-freshman team at Rice, then went 10-0 with a 2.36 ERA as a sophomore on a loaded San Jacinto (Texas) JC staff in 2019, when he turned down the Diamondbacks as a 23rd-rounder. He provided one of the highlights of the shortened college season, no-hitting Louisiana State with 11 strikeouts, though he got hit hard in two of his three other outings. He throws strikes with four generally average pitches, the best of which are a low-90s sinker and a slider/cutter."
"Daniel Federman",NA,"P","Miami","4YR JR","Pembroke Pines","FL","USA","L","R","Almost exclusively a reliever over the course of his career at Miami, Federman has been the Hurricanes closer the past two seasons and was off to a very good start before the shutdown. There are teams that believe he can start thanks to a legitimate four-pitch mix, though he struggled in that role last summer in the Cape Cod League. Hell throw his fastball in the 90-94 range and complements it well with his slider and changeup. He also mixes in an effective curve. He throws strikes and is willing to take the ball in any role."
"Mat Olsen",NA,"P","Central Arizona College","JC J2","Florence","AZ","USA","R","R","An undersized right-hander with arm strength, Olsens name started popping up early this spring with a spike in velocity. He was up to 94-95 mph with his heater early on, but didnt have a chance to show if he could maintain it throughout his entire junior college season because of the pandemic. The University of Arizona commit complements his fastball with a hard low-80s slider and had struck out more than 15 per nine innings over seven starts this spring. With a high-effort delivery, Olsen might be headed for a bullpen long-term, where his competitiveness would be a plus."
"Braden Olthoff",NA,"P","Tulane","4YR JR","Oceanside","CA","USA","R","R","An unheralded transfer who went undrafted out of high school and during two years at Palomar (Calif.) JC, Olthoff recorded a 0.32 ERA in four starts this spring, ranking third in NCAA Division I in strikeouts (47) and sixth in WHIP (0.54). He struck out 16 against Cal State Fullerton, then worked the first six innings of a no-hitter against Middle Tennessee State in his next outing. He stands out more for his sink, command and deception than his pure stuff, usually operating at 88-92 mph and peaking at 94 mph with his fastball. His curveball, slider and changeup are generally average, though any of them can be his best pitch on a given day."
"Michael Brown",NA,"1B","Vacaville HS","HS SR","Raleigh","NC","USA","L","L","Anyone interested in Brown, the NorCal high school standout, will be buying the bat. The 6-foot-5 first baseman has tremendous raw power from the left side of the plate. Long levers have led to some problems with velocity and pitches on the inner half of the plate, but he can drive the ball the other way and recognizes spin well. Hes slimmed down over the past year but is definitely limited to first base. Whether he can be signed away from his commitment to the University of Washington remains to be seen."
"Mario Zabala",NA,"OF","International Baseball Academy","HS SR","San Juan",NA,"Puerto Rico","R","R","Based on raw tools, Zabala is the best prospect in Puerto Rico in this Draft class, but questions abound about him being able to use his tools performance-wise on a consistent basis at the next level. The Florida International recruit has tremendous raw power, but also displayed a ton of swing and miss against top competition. He runs well and has a strong arm, with a profile as an athletic power-hitting corner outfielder if it all clicks."
"Tanner Bibee",NA,"P","Cal State Fullerton","4YR JR","Mission Viejo","CA","USA","R","R","Cal State Fullerton has a reputation for producing starting pitchers who know how to command the baseball and Bibee is no exception. He became a full-time starter as a sophomore, and though he pitched well in relief on the Cape last summer, he opened his junior year as Fullertons Friday night starter and threw well over four starts. He does it with average stuff across the board at best, with a fastball that can touch 92-93 mph at times, a solid slider and a decent changeup. It plays up because of his ability to command all three, though theres not a ton of margin for error and his ceiling is somewhat limited."
"Billy Cook",NA,"3B","Pepperdine","4YR JR","Layton","UT","USA","R","R","Cooks parents were collegiate athletes at Air Force, his father a baseball player, his mother a basketball and volleyball player, and he brings that athleticism to his game. Hes played both the infield and outfield for Pepperdine for three years and teams that like him think his speed will allow him to stay in center field. He was taking a nice step forward in his offensive production this year, showing above-average power at times, though there is some swing and miss to his game. Scouts havent gotten as many looks at Cook as some other college performers because he came from the Colorado high school ranks and missed a chunk of his sophomore season with a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder."
"Zach Daniels",NA,"CF","Tennessee","4YR JR","Stockbridge","GA","USA","R","R","Daniels has loud tools and helped his cause by batting .357/.478/.750 this spring, but scouts never got the chance to see how he'd fare against tougher pitching in Southeastern Conference play. His hitting ability remains a question because he batted a combined .176 with a 38 percent strikeout rate in his first two seasons and put up worse numbers in the Cape Cod League last summer. He's enticing because he offers well above-average raw power from the right side of the plate, plus speed, an average arm and a chance to play center field."
"Riley Tirotta",NA,"3B","Dayton","4YR JR","South Bend","IN","USA","R","R","Dayton has produced three big leaguers, including Jerry Blevins and Craig Stammen, but never has had a player selected in the first 10 rounds. Tirotta could have been the first Flyer to go that early, but that became less likely when the 2020 Draft was reduced to five rounds. He's an impressive athlete, a 6-foot-3, 210-pounder who can display double-plus speed, plus right-handed raw power and the arm strength and quickness to play a quality third base. There are major concerns about his bat, however, because he's a career .241 hitter at Dayton and batted .156 in the Cape Cod League last summer."
"Nander De Sedas",NA,"SS","Florida State","4YR SO","Panama City",NA,"Panama","S","R","De Sedas was a solid prep product from the same high school that produced Francisco Lindor, but an uneven spring in 2018 and a commitment to Florida State meant he didnt get taken until the 29th round that June, so he headed to Tallahassee knowing hed be a Draft-eligible sophomore in 2020. A switch-hitter who is a little bit better from the left side, with a little more power on the right, hes struggled to hit consistently in his year-plus at Florida State. He does show off solid defensive skills but is prone to mistakes, particularly on throws. That, along with his fringe-average speed, has some scouts thinking hes better suited for second base than shortstop at the next level."
"Cody Greenhill",NA,"P","Auburn","4YR JR","Russellville","AL","USA","R","R","Greenhill has posted a 2.59 ERA with 19 saves in two-plus years at Auburn, and he didn't allow a run while logging a 17/1 K/BB ratio in 12 2/3 innings this spring. He can run his fastball up to 95 mph and back it up with an average slider that tunnels well with his heater, though he tends to operate closer to 90 mph when he pitches on the second of consecutive days. Scouts don't love his arm action but his mechanics provide deception and his 6-foot-4 frame helps create good angle on his pitches."
"Michael Guldberg",NA,"SS","Georgia Tech","4YR JR","Woodstock","GA","USA","R","R","Guldberg led the Atlantic Coast Conference in hitting (.450) while striking out just three times in 72 plate appearances during the shortened 2020 season, and he ranked second in the ACC batting race (.361) a year ago. He excels at putting the bat on the ball with a flat right-handed swing and he has solid speed, but he also presents a tough profile because his approach yields little power and his defensive home is uncertain. He injured his throwing shoulder as a freshman, spent almost all of his sophomore year at DH and played left field with a below-average arm this spring. It's possible that he could play center field and he did see some action at second base in 2018."
"Alex Freeland",NA,"SS","Mariner HS","HS SR","Louisville","KY","USA","S","R","Hailing from the same high school that produced big league catcher Mike Zunino, Freeland made a name for himself with strong play over the summer. He stands out mostly because of his bat, with the ability to impact the baseball from both sides of the plate, with some power to come. Most scouts dont feel hell be able to stick at shortstop, his position at Mariner High School, but the Central Florida recruit could be a solid offensive-minded second baseman in the future."
"Mason Hickman",NA,"P","Vanderbilt","4YR JR","Salt Lake City","UT","USA","R","R","Hickman's stuff hasnt stood out on Vanderbilt's loaded pitching staffs, but he has been a consistent winner who has gone 19-2 with a 3.13 ERA in three college seasons and earned the victory in the College World Series clincher last June. His best pitch is his solid curveball, and he also has an 88-91 mph fastball that misses bats because of his command and deception. He throws strikes and keeps hitters off balance by mixing in a slider and changeup, making him a high-floor guy who might become a back-of-the-rotation starter."
"Bailey Horn",NA,"P","Auburn","4YR JR","Waco","TX","USA","L","L","Horn missed the 2018 season at McLennan (Texas) CC following Tommy John surgery but has bounced back at Auburn to become one of the better redshirt juniors available in the 2020 Draft. His best weapon is a low-80s slider that shows flashes of becoming a plus offering. He also has a low-90s fastball that tops out at 94 mph, a get-me-over curveball and an effective changeup, showing enough pitches and the control to remain a starter."
"Matthew Dyer",NA,"C","Arizona","4YR SR","Phoenix","AZ","USA","R","R","It hasnt been a direct path for Dyer, who began his college career in 2017 at Oregon, sat out in 2018 as he transferred to Arizona and then went undrafted in 2019. He was off to a slow start offensively before the season ended this spring, but there are some tools to like here. Dyer is a plus runner with an easily plus arm who shows above-average defensive skills behind the plate. Hes also athletic enough to play center field and second base, pointing to a potential future career as a super-utility type. While he has added a little strength to his long and lean frame, his offensive profile is somewhat limited."
"Wil Jensen",NA,"P","Pepperdine","4YR SR","Phoenix","AZ","USA","R","R","Jensen was off to a very good start as a sophomore in 2018 until he needed Tommy John surgery. While he returned for only three appearances in 2019, the As took him in the 28th round last June, but returned to Pepperdine and was off to a very good start as the Waves Friday night starter. Theres some projection to his 6-foot-3 frame and he has a potential four-pitch mix, with a fastball up to 93 mph, a changeup that has the chance to be a plus pitch, and a distinct curve and slider, all of which hes shown the ability to command fairly well."
"Cullen Kafka",NA,"P","Oregon","4YR JR","Walnut Creek","CA","USA","R","R","Kafka worked mostly as a reliever as a freshman at Oregon then moved into the rotation as a sophomore and was the Ducks Friday night starter during the short-lived 2020 season. At 6-foot-4 and about 220 pounds, the right-hander certainly fits the mold as a workhorse type and he has a potential three-pitch mix with a fastball that touches 94 mph, a slider and a changeup. Command issues have held him back, however, leading some to think he might best be suited for a bullpen role."
"Niko Kavadas",NA,"3B","Notre Dame","4YR JR","South Bend","IN","USA","L","R","Kavadas is all about left-handed power and tied for the Atlantic Coast Conference lead with seven homers in 13 games this spring after tying for first in the Cape Cod League with nine longballs last summer. He scores very well in various hitting metrics, producing impressive launch angles and exit velocities while earning well above-average grades for his raw pop from some scouts. He's somewhat similar to Mike Adams with less hitting ability -- he has a career .280 average at Notre Dame -- and his lack of athleticism and arm strength may land him at DH."
"Chris Lanzilli",NA,"LF","Wake Forest","4YR JR","Stoneham","MA","USA","R","R","Lanzilli slammed 16 homers as a sophomore-eligible at Wake Forest last season but fell to the Giants in the 39th round of the 2019 Draft because he wasn't particularly signable. He went deep six times through 18 games in 2020, though there still are some questions about how well his right-handed pop will play against wood bats and quality offspeed pitches at the next level. A fringy runner with solid arm strength, he has made strides with his corner-outfield defense but looked overmatched at third base when he played there this spring."
"Christian McGowan",NA,"P","Eastern Oklahoma State JC","JC J1","Denison","TX","USA","R","R","McGowan attracted attention when he opened the spring with double-digit strikeouts efforts in his first three starts, and he finished fourth in the national juco ranks with 58 whiffs in 35 1/3 innings. He works with a 90-96 mph fastball, has the makings of a solid low-80s slider and has some aptitude for throwing a changeup. He's athletic but needs to smooth out his delivery and control. He'll head to Kansas State if he doesn't sign this summer."
"Brandon Pfaadt",NA,"P","Bellarmine University","4YR JR","Louisville","KY","USA","R","R","NCAA Division-II Bellarmine's best prospect since Todd Wellmeyer (a fourth-round pick in 2000), Pfaadt made a name for himself by starring in the Northwoods and Cape Cod Leagues the last two summers. He can touch 95 mph with his heavy sinker and back it up with a solid breaking ball, throwing strikes with both pitches as well as his average changeup. He has a strong 6-foot-4 frame, but his stuff tends to drop off after a couple of innings so he profiles better as a reliever."
"Michael Kirian",NA,"P","Louisville","4YR JR","New Riegel","OH","USA","R","L","One of the better lefty relievers available, Kirian earned saves in all six of his appearances this spring, while allowing three baserunners and fanning 11 in 6 1/3 innings. He usually operates with a 90-93 mph fastball that reaches 95 and a solid slurve. He's not overpowering but his stuff plays up because of the deception in his delivery, and he uses his 6-foot-6 frame to create a difficult angle against left-handers."
"Mitchell Parker",NA,"P","San Jacinto College North","JC J2","Albuquerque","NM","USA","L","L","Parker turned down the Cubs as a 28th-rounder out of a New Mexico high school in 2018 and the Rays as a 27th-rounder as a freshman last year, and he'll likely get drafted for the third straight June after leading Division-I junior college pitchers in strikeouts (64) and strikeout rate (19.0 per nine innings). JUCO hitters have had difficulty catching up to his 90-94 mph fastball, which features deception and downhill plane, and his mid-70s overhand curveball. His long arm action and control leave something to be desired, so he projects more as a reliever than as a starter. If he doesn't sign this summer, he'll attend Kentucky in 2021."
"Michael Rothenberg",NA,"C","Duke","4YR JR","Miami Beach","FL","USA","S","R","Rothenberg has some of the best tools in this year's college catching crop, displaying solid raw power from both sides of the plate, plus arm strength and the hands to be a quality receiver. But there also are questions about his bat and defense, because he hit .200 with a 29 percent strikeout rate in the Cape Cod League last summer and he lacks consistency behind the plate. He performed well (.349/.551/.605) in the shortened college season and may have enough pop to make it at first base if he can't stick at catcher."
"Jake DeLeo",NA,"CF","Avon Old Farms School","HS SR","Stamford","CT","USA","R","R","Scouts didnt get the chance to follow up on this talented Connecticut high school standout this spring after he showed off some tools on the summer showcase circuit. Deleo is already fairly physically mature, without much projection left in his 6-foot-2 frame, but theres plenty of current strength and raw power for the right-handed hitter to tap into, especially if he can refine his overall approach. Deleo, committed to Georgia Tech, has caught and played the outfield and has shown enough speed and athleticism to roam the outfield at the next level."
"Gabe Shepard",NA,"P","Southern Mississippi","4YR SO","Mobile","AL","USA","R","R","Shepard had Tommy John surgery as a high school senior in 2018, then came on strong at the end of his freshman season, working 7 1/3 innings of a combined no-hitter against Rice in the Conference USA tournament and popping 97 mph in the NCAA regional playoffs. Draft-eligible as a sophomore because he's 21 years old, he usually pitches with a 91-95 mph fastball and flashes a plus slider. He's 5-foot-10 and throws with effort, so there are starter versus reliever questions, and he doesn't come with much track record after pitching just 42 innings in two years at Southern Miss."
"Noah Skirrow",NA,"P","Liberty University","4YR JR","Cambridge","ON","Canada","R","R","Skirrow has taken a nice step forward, starting with a strong performance last summer in the Cape Cod League. In the past, Skirrow was known mostly for his 90-93 mph fastball with ordinary secondary stuff. But hes added a cutter, thrown 88-90 mph, that should be at least average in the future. It has some depth to it, and he was getting left-handed hitters to swing over it. He does have an average changeup and a below average breaking ball, so a team could send him out as a starter, but he might be suited best for a relief role where his fastball-cutter combination would play up a bit."
"Gavin Stone",NA,"P","Central Arkansas","4YR JR","Lake City","AR","USA","R","R","Stone made a successful transition from closer in 2019 to starter this spring, throwing a 13-strikeout no-hitter against Southeastern Louisiana in his final outing of the abbreviated season. At 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, he's smaller than desired for a starter, but he throws strikes with three pitches: a 90-92 mph fastball that peaks at 94, a hard slider and a changeup. In shorter stints in the past, he has run his heater up to 96."
"Devonte Brown",NA,"3B","North Carolina State","4YR JR","Hinesville","GA","USA","R","R","Swing-and-miss issues prevented Brown from claiming more than a bench role in his first two seasons at North Carolina State, but he batted .338/.429/.692 with five homers in 17 games this spring (albeit with a 23 percent strikeout rate). His bat speed and strength give him plus raw power from the right side of the plate. An average to solid runner with a strong arm, he gets mixed reviews for his play at third base and may wind up in right field after playing both positions this spring."
"Brendan Beck",NA,"P","Stanford","4YR JR","La Jolla","CA","USA","R","R","Teams interested in Beck, the younger brother of current Giants prospect Tristan Beck, will be ones that like college performers. The right-hander has been a member of Stanfords rotation since his freshman year and has had success with a four-pitch mix and excellent command. His fastball is average, at best, with a lack of deception and just fair life to it. Beck's above-average slider is his best secondary pitch and he mixes in an average changeup and fringy curve effectively. Some scouts see some ceiling as a starter because, as a player who entered Stanford as a two-way guy, hes still relatively new to focusing on pitching."
"Hayes Heinecke",NA,"P","Wofford","4YR SO","Fayetteville","GA","USA","L","L","The 2019 Southern Conference Freshman of the Year after leading the league in wins and going 10-2 with a 2.65 ERA, Heinecke was even sharper in four starts as a Draft-eligible sophomore this spring. More strong than tall at 5-foot-11 and 200 pounds, he provides strikes with three pitches and owns a 120/18 K/BB ratio in 114 college innings. His best pitch is his changeup, which he sets up with an 88-92 mph fastball and a decent curveball."
"Darren Baker",NA,"2B","California","4YR JR","Redwood City","CA","USA","L","R","The son of Dusty Baker, Darren is best known as being the bat boy whisked away to safety by J.T. Snow in the 2002 World Series. After three years as a starter at Cal, including a strong performance on the Cape last summer, hes looking to show people hes more than a piece of trivia. He can really hit, with an advanced approach, using all fields. A plus runner without much power, he profiles best as a leadoff type. Hes gotten better defensively on the infield, giving him a chance to stick at second, but some think hell best be suited for center field long-term, with his plus makeup giving him the chance to maximize his tools."
"Jared Viertel",NA,"P","Crowder College","JC J2","Columbia","MO","USA","R","R","The coronavirus shutdown severely impacted Viertel's Draft chances because he was building momentum and beginning to attract scouts when the junior college season ended in mid-March. His stuff took a step forward from the fall, with the projectable 6-foot-3 right-hander displaying a 90-94 mph fastball with riding action, flashes of a plus curveball and feel for a changeup this spring. His command and control are more works in progress. If he doesn't sign this summer, he'll pitch at Missouri State next spring."
"Kaden Polcovich",NA,"SS","Oklahoma State","4YR JR","Edmond","OK","USA","L","R","The son of former big leaguer Kevin Polcovich, Kaden is a similar player whose grinder mentality helps him get the most out of his fringy-to-average tools. After spending the first semester of his college career at Kentucky and playing his first two seasons at Northwest Florida State JC, he batted .344/.494/.578 with 19 walks and eight steals in 18 games for Oklahoma State this spring. The stocky 5-foot-8 switch-hitter performed well in the Cape Cod League last summer as well, though he profiles more as utilityman than as a regular."
"Calvin Ziegler",NA,"P","St Mary's Catholic SS","HS SR","Heidelberg","ON","Canada","R","R","The top two Canadian talents in this years Draft class are both outfielders, but theres no question Ziegler is the best arm. While hes just six-foot, hes very athletic on the mound (hes a solid outfielder as well), allowing him to make adjustments and maintain his delivery. His fastball typically sits 91-92 mph, but he can reach back for more occasionally. He has the makings of a plus curve and he has some feel for a changeup, where his athleticism should come into play and allow him to have a solid three-pitch mix. The UConn commit will need to keep refining his command and not trying to do too much so he can stay within his delivery more consistently."
